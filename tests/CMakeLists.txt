# Tests -- building/running is aggregated within a separate directory
#          so they do not interact/pollute main build space
#
# yoh: for some reason WORKING_DIRECTORY is not quite working for me
#      says BAD_COMMAND for the binary to be executed.  That is why
#      this solution with tests/ directory
