# This file can be helpful to set up the compilers on OSX. An alternative
# perfectly usable strategy is to set the environment variables CC and CXX and
# possibly LDFLAGS (CXX is used for compiling dcm2niix, you can avoid this
# dependency by set USE_SYSTEM_DCM2NIIX=ON).  This file is used by calling
# cmake with the additional option "-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=path/to/this/file".

# General notes:
# AppleClang does not have openmp support by default. You can install libomp
# with homebrew if you do want to use this compiler and build with OMP.
# On MacOS  /usr/bin/gcc is actually symlinked to clang. You have to go out of
# your way to use gcc (set the compiler path explicitly)
# Below is a list of working examples for the various compilers. You may have
# to modify the paths below to suit your system/compiler version.

# # The different compilers can be chosen by setting the AFNI_COMPILER_CHOICE variable
# See https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.18/variable/CMAKE_LANG_COMPILER_ID.html
