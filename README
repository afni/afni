AFNI directory
--------------
backup = script to backup all non-CVS contents to another directory [RWC only]
bin/   = holds scripts for CVS usage (does NOT hold AFNI binaries!)
doc/   = documentation for AFNI
src/   = source code for AFNI

Cadd file [file ...]
  adds new files to CVS repository from working directory
Cget

Chelp
  prints this message
Cmv aa bb
  rename file 'aa' to 'bb' in working directory and in CVS repository
Cnew

Cput file [file ...]

cvs -H [command]

CVS Setup
---------
To create the initial setup for AFNI, you must do the following:
  1) make sure afni:/home2 is NFS-mounted on /net/afni/home2
       [should be in /etc/fstab on your system]
  2) setenv CVSROOT /net/afni/home2/AFNI_CVS
       [should set this in your .cshrc file]
  3) cvs checkout AFNI
       [do this in your home directory to create AFNI/]
  4) cd AFNI/src
       [can begin editing now!!!]
       [put changes back to CVS with Cput, Cadd, et cetera]
       [subdirectories rwcox/ rickr/ ziad/ are for private use]
       [subdirectory matlab/ is for Matlab stuff - duh]

Compilation
-----------
In src/, Makefile is set up to install into INSTALLDIR = ~/abin (which
must already exist - it won't make the directory).  This Makefile is
for Linux.  To make and install everything and remove *.o files, do
  make totality
To make and install everything, but keep *.o files, do
  make vastness
(as usual, "make clean" will remove *.o files).

If you add a new program, you need to add a rule for it in Makefile.INCLUDE;
just take a look at the rules that already exist.
