CVS Setup
---------
To create the initial setup for AFNI, you must do the following:
  1) make sure afni:/home2 is NFS-mounted on /net/afni/home2
       [should be in /etc/fstab on your system]
  2) setenv CVSROOT /net/afni/home2/AFNI_CVS
       [should set this in your .cshrc file]
  3) cvs checkout AFNI
       [do this in your home directory to create AFNI/]
  4) cd AFNI/src
       [can begin editing now!!!]
       [put changes back to CVS with Cput, Cadd, et cetera]
       [subdirectories rwcox/ rickr/ ziad/ are for private use]
