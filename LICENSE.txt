Q. Who are the primary developers of the AFNI software package?

A. AFNI was started by Robert W. Cox at the Medical College of
   Wisconsin in 1994. Today, the primary developers of AFNI are the
   members of the NIMH's Scientific and Statistical Computing Core
   (SSCC), though many members of the neuroimaging community have also
   made (and continue to make) valuable contributions.

Q. I am not a member of the NIMH's SSCC. Can I contribute to the AFNI
   source code?  What kind of licensing will apply to my contribution?

A. Yes, many people have contributed to AFNI over the years!  You can
   make pull requests on the AFNI GitHub page
   (https://github.com/afni/afni), as well as raise Issues there. It
   is often useful to be in contact with the primary software
   developers (members of the NIMH's Scientific and Statistical
   Computing Core (SSCC)) early on in the process.

   US Government employees' work will automatically be in the Public
   Domain.  Other contributions may have difference licensing, but
   note that this is an open source, publicly available community
   resource, and the intention is to have it remain so.  Any 3rd party
   contributions should have appropriate licensing noted.
   Contributions without explicit licensing will be assumed to be
   entered into the public domain.  To make contributions with any
   explicit licensing, please contact the SSCC as early as possible.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Q. So, what _is_ the distribution license?

A. Large portions of the code (and current active development) is in
   the public domain. For example, the `afnipy` Python module is
   entirely within the public domain.

   But as outlined above, parts of the codebase also contain licenses,
   such as GNU GPL 2.0, MIT, Apache 2.0, BSD, Apple Public Source, and
   various free/permissive licensing descriptions; some very small
   subsets contain "contact the author before redistribution"
   notices.  Please review the relevant license for distribution terms
   and conditions or directly contact the contributing author for more
   information, as necessary.
