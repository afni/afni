**********************
Using @snapshot_volreg
**********************

.. highlight:: Tcsh

``@snapshot_volreg`` is an useful program for quickly evaluating
alignment between two datasets, for example between a subject's
anatomical and an EPI volume, or between an anatomical and a standard
space template. This program creates an edge-ified overlay of one data
on the underlayed other, allowing for quick checks of the similarity
of major brain features.

The output is a :math:`3\times3` montage: one row each of axial,
coronal and sagittal slices.

**NOTE:** when evaluating goodness of alignment, you want to see how
well the edges of structures and features line up.  You will also see
additional information such as the FOV coverage of your data set and
possibly useful things like how well skull-stripping was done.  To
some data sets more deeply, you may want to follow-up by looking at
them interactively in the AFNI GUI.

Examples
========

**Syntax:** The application of this program is really pretty straightforward:
provide the ulay volume name, the olay volume name, and then possibly
a prefix for the output JPG file.

The examples presented here use publicly available data, distributed
as part of the freely downloadable AFNI Bootcamp demo sets (see
:ref:`here <Bootcamping>`). Specifically, these commands refer to
files in the ``AFNI_data6/FT_analysis/FT/`` directory, and then
datasets *created* from that subject's data using the class
``afni_proc.py`` example.  Therefore, for most of the examples here,
you will have wanted to run the following in order to follow along at
home::
  
  cd ~/AFNI_data6/FT_analysis/
  tcsh s05.ap.uber

After that, there will be a subdirectory of afni_proc.py results
created called ``FT.results/``, and unless otherwise stated the
example commands here are run within that directory
(``AFNI_data6/FT_analysis/FT.results/``).

.. note:: In this example Bootcamp script, only linear affine
          alignment is performed to standard space.  In real analyses,
          we typically recommend using nonlinear warping, but that
          takes too long for the script to run within the Bootcamp
          class lecture time.  Therefore, one might expect pretty
          good, but not excellent, alignment between the subject
          volumes and the standard space template here.  

          But the point of these examples is *viewing* the data,
          indeed to find out such things, so we aren't really bothered
          by that here.

**Ex. 0**: Anatomical + EPI alignment (in final template space)
---------------------------------------------------------------

A display of how the anatomical and an EPI volume overlay after
alignment.  The dsets are shown after their warping to standard space.

The anatomical is the underlay (setting the grid resolution), and the
olay is "edge-ified".

| 

| **Question:** Why is there an area of color in the leftmost axial view?
| **(Likely) Answer:** Well, the edge of the FOV of that EPI data set
happens to fall mainly in that slice place of the anat after
alignment, so we see a lot of its boundary layer here.  This
interpretation holds with seeing where the lowest olay edges occur in
the sagittal+coronal slices.

| **Question:** Why are there color lines outside the brain?

| **(Likely) Answer:** The EPI was not skullstripped, just automasked
for visualization purposes; that process is approximate, and we might
expect some stuff to appear still outside the brain, such as in the
medial-sagittal slices where the sagittal sinus (hard to remove
algorithmically!) might not have been removed, and/or around other
boundary points.

**Ex. 1**: Anatomical + EPI alignment (in intermediate EPI space)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The same datasets as the preceding example, but with the volumes shown
in the EPI space (as calculated by align_epi_anat.py in an
intermediate step in the "align" block).  Just a bit of a different
perspective.

          :align: center
|

| **Question:** So, is it better to view this in standard space or EPI space?

| **(Possible) Answer:** Both can be useful in their own way.  The
standard space version is nice because that is the final, meaningful
result; and if I wanted to check a *group's* worth of data, I would
flip through a stack of these images (e.g., from Linux command line:
``eog group/sub-*/svr_*final_anat_epi.jpg``) and since see if any
major differences popped out, since they should all be aligned to the
saaaame space.  However, if something went wrong, it would be nice to
check individual alignment steps to see which one went wrong (EPI ->
anat, or anat -> template, or ...), too.

**Ex. 5**: @SSwarper results for anatomical-to-template alignment
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The ``@SSwarper`` program performs both skullstripping of an
anatomical volume and nonlinear alignment to standard space (these
dual roles feed into each other, so it can be useful to do them
simultaneously).  The program also uses ``@snapshot_volreg``
internally, twice, to provide auto-QC imaging of results of both
features (anat under template edges, and template under anat edges).

For more information about ``@SSwarper`` (get to know it!), and how it
can be used as a useful precursor to ``afni_proc.py``, see :ref:`the
@SSwarper help page <ahelp_@SSwarper>` and :ref:`the @SSwarper template base
page <tempatl_sswarper_base>`.

The present example is run in a *different* location than the others,
and does not require the "s05*" script to have been run.  It is run
in: ``/data/CD/AFNI_data6/FT_analysis/FT``.

**Parallelization:** note that since @SSwarper wraps around 3dQwarp
for nonlinear alignment, you will want to be using the inherent
parallelizability of the program on your computer (if you have
multiple cores). It has a default value, and you control this by
setting the "OMP_NUM_THREADS" environment variable in either a script
or your RC files (just running the help file of ``3dQwarp`` should
show you what it is presently set at).  If you have any questions
about this, `just ask
<https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/afni/community/board/>`_!
