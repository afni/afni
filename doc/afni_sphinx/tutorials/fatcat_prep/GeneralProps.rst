Specifying output location and prefix
-------------------------------------

| *The Naming of Cats is a difficult matter,*
| *It isn't just one of your holiday games;*
| *You may think at first I'm as mad as a hatter*
| *When I tell you, a cat must have THREE DIFFERENT NAMES.*
| --T. S. Eliot

Fortunately, the naming of outputs isn't *so* complicated as that, but
one can essentially output with two names: a new subdirectory and a
prefix for filenames.  For each ``fat_proc`` function, one can use
``-prefix *`` to either put files of a given prefix into a preexisting
directory, or to both create a new subdirectory and put files of a
given prefix there.  Thus, consider an example using ``-prefix
/somewhere/group/AAA/bbb``:

* if there is an existing directory "/somewhere/group/AAA/", then this
  option would put files starting with "bbb" into it;

* if there were just an empty, preexisting directory called
  "/somewhere/group/", then this option would first create a new
  subdirectory "/somewhere/group/AAA/" and then populate it with files
  starting with "bbb";

* if there were just an empty directory called "/somewhere/", then
  this option would lead to failure-- it can only create a new output
  directory one layer deep.


Automatic QC imaging
--------------------

Most ``fat_proc`` functions automatically generate sets of montaged
images (PNG files by default).  In each case the choice of image(s) is
mainly just due to what I thought might be useful or have found myself
creating often in order to evaluate a given step or the state of a
particular data set. These are done automatically by driving AFNI,
internally selecting overlays, thresholds, etc. that the user would
otherwise have to do by hand for each image, and saving everything in
an image file. By default, a set of axial, sagittal and coronal views
are made.

For 3D volumes, the montage size is typically 15 slices as evenly
spaced as possible across each FOV dimension.  These may show just an
underlay, or underlays with either a translucent/masked overlay or an
"edge-ified" image (esp. for judging alignment).  

Definitions:
* **ulay**: underlay data set; always grayscale here

* **olay**: overlay data set; can be made using one of many
  colorscales, may also be translucent or outline edges

     * - .. image:: media/t1w__qc00_anat.cor.png
            :width: 100%   
            :align: center
     * - *Multiple slices evenly spaced across FOV dimension (by
         approx. 1/(15-1)th of the length) for an T1w anatomical
         volume (coronal view, left=left).  Each slice is labelled by
         physical 'xyz' coordinate, in mm. 2-98\% brightness scale for
         the volume.*

For 4D data, the montage typically shows a single slice across all
time points (which, for DWI, might just represent different DW
volumes).  The *N* images are arranged in something close to a golden
ratio array, padded at the end as necessary to have a solid grid of
images.  Additionally, a GIF or MPG movie may be created.  Images may
have a single scaling (grayscale: black=2% and white=98% brightness)
across the whole volume ("onescl") or separate scalings (again, 2-98%)
for each volume ("sepscl"), each highlighting useful features for
comparisons.

  .. list-table:: 
     :header-rows: 1
     :widths: 100

     * - Examples of 4D autoimage output
     * - .. image:: media/pa_onescl.cor.png
            :width: 100%   
            :align: center
     * - *Single slice from 3 b=0 and 30 b=1100 DWIs, all with same
         brightness scale (coronal view, left=left).  Each volume
         index is numbered; two empty images at the end ("#33" and
         "#34") are merely empty elements to complete the matrix
         shape.*
     * - .. image:: media/pa_sepscl.cor.png
            :width: 100%   
            :align: center
     * - *Same volume and single slice as above, but with separate
         2-98\% brightness scales for each volume (coronal view,
         left=left).*

These images represent a benefit of batch processing: one can
*systematize* the visual checks of processed data.  That is, we can
create very similar, comparable views across the group of data being
processed, and then one can look through all these images quickly in
succession to check for similarity or subtle patterns of difference.
I find these sets of images **very** helpful for the process of
understanding my data, checking the homogeneity of processing across a
group, and seeing quickly any subjects that need to be reprocessed.
These are also very useful sitting down with someone else (supervisor,
student, colleague, etc.) and showing a lot of processed data quickly.

I typically process data on a Linux machine, and I use the ``eog``
(Eye of Gnome) function to view lots of images in quick succession.
For example, say that I have data organized as a "group/" directory,
with subdirectories for each subject ("group/subj_001/",
"group/subj_002/", etc.) and some PNG files output in each
(img_QC_00.sag.png, img_QC_00.cor.png, img_QC_00.axi.png,
img_QC_01.sag.png, img_QC_01.cor.png, img_QC_01.axi.png, etc.).  Then
I might be interested in looking at all the sagittal images from my
"\*00\*" QC test.  I could load up the specified images from the
command line by typing with wildcards ("\*"), for example::

  eog group/subj_*/img*00*sag*png

I would then just need to hit the "right" and "left" arrow keys to go
forward and backward through the list of images. NB: with `eog`, to
see the full path for a file name, one can right click on any image
and select "Properties" and see the path (and the field updates as one
traverses images); additionally, one can set "View -> Side Pane" to
see file information.  I usually have "View -> Best Fit" toggled ON. 

.. note:: It is possible to install ``eog`` on Mac OS.  One might also
          have another viewing program of choice-- use whatever you
          find easiest for viewing your data!


Temporary working directories
-----------------------------

Most ``fat_proc`` functions perform several sub-steps, and therefore
they make use of temporary working directories.  By default, these are
deleted or "cleaned up."  If you want to keep them, for example if
some step is failing and you want more information about why, you can
instruct them to not be deleted using the ``-no_clean`` switch.


Shell and scripting choices in these docs
-----------------------------------------

The command line blocs in these tutorial docs will use ``tcsh``
scripting notation from time to time, for example defining something
as a variable and then using that variable in a ``fat_proc`` function,
such as::

  set dirname = "/data/DTI_EXAMPLE_DATA/data_proc/SUBJ_001/dwi_00"

  fat_proc_something                  \
      -prefix $dirname/subj_314159    \
      ...

This is often done to simplify script reading, shortening lines by
wrapping up long file paths into a single variable, or purely on whim.

Some people feel strongly about ``tcsh`` vs ``bash`` or other shells--
I am not smart enough to care deeply, fortunately or unfortunately.
Please feel free to translate any of these statements into whatever
shell or scripting language, such as Python, that you would wish.
