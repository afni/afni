    Usage: @1dDiffMag file.1D
    * Computes a magnitude estimate of the first differences of a 1D file.
    * Differences are computed down each column.
    * The result -- a single number -- is on stdout.
    * But (I hear you say), what IS the result?
    * For each column, the standard deviation of the first differences is computed.
