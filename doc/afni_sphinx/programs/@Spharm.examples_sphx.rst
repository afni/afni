    Usage: @Spharm.examples
    A script to demonstrate the usage of spherical harmonics decomposition 
    with SUMA
    
    To run it you will need some of SUMA's N27 tlrc surfaces, which can be 
    downloaded from: https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/tgz/suma_tlrc.tgz
    The surfaces needed are lh.pial.tlrc.ply, lh.smoothwm.tlrc.ply, lh.sphere.asc, and N27_lh_tlrc.spec
    
    To change the parameter settings, make a copy of this script
    and modify the section at the top called 'INIT_VARS'
    If you do not make a copy of this script, future AFNI updates will
    overwrite your changes.
