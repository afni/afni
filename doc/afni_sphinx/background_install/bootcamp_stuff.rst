**Basic Bootcamp Prep**

#. **Get the most uptodate AFNI on your computer.**

   * **IF** you do *not* have AFNI set up on your computer system at
     all, then please see the step-by-step instructions (which
     optionally include installing the Bootcamp data, so then you will
     be all set):

     - for :ref:`Linux <install_steps_linux>`

     - for :ref:`Mac OS <install_steps_mac>`

     - for Windows users... eek.

     Methods for checking/evaluating each setup are also described on
     those pages.  PLEASE make sure you have verified that all is well
     with AFNI on your computer.

   * **ELSE** (you have AFNI set up on your computer, but you are
     not certain that it is the most up-to-date version), please
     do the following:

     + *if you have installed pre-compiled binaries on your computer (the
       most common approach)*::

         @update.binaries.afni -d

     + *if you compile AFNI from source*, then go :ref:`here
       <download_SRC>` and download the latest source.
