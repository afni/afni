**Fedora and Red Hat Linux**: *The essential system setup*
==============================================================


Here we describe installation and system setup for reasonably modern
Linux versions of Fedora (21+) and Red Hat (RHEL) 7, along with the
corresponding CentOS 7.

Several of the following steps are system dependent, for example due
to having different package managers, so we list parallel instructions
for each.

#. **Install prerequisite packages.**

   .. note:: This is the only step that requires sudo ability.

   There are several packages and libraries that are needed to run the
   afni and shell programs, often even including ``tcsh``:

   * *for Fedora 21 (and higher)*::
      
       sudo yum install -y tcsh libXp openmotif gsl xorg-x11-fonts-misc       \
                           PyQt4 R-devel netpbm-progs gnome-tweak-tool ed     \
                           xorg-x11-server-Xvfb
       sudo yum update -y
      
   * *for RHEL/CentOS 7*:

     .. note:: R-devel requires epel-release (Extra Packages for Enterprize Linux)

     on CentOS 7 one can enable epel-release easily::

        sudo yum install -y epel-release

     install libraries (once epel-release is enabled)::

        sudo yum install -y tcsh libXp openmotif gsl xorg-x11-fonts-misc       \
                            PyQt4 R-devel netpbm-progs gnome-tweak-tool ed     \
                            libpng12 xorg-x11-server-Xvfb
        sudo yum update -y
            
   .. _setup_FRH_tcsh:
#. **(optional, but recommended) Set "tcsh" to be the default shell.**

   ::

      chsh -s /usr/bin/tcsh

#. **Install AFNI.**

   The following will create a directory called ``$HOME/abin`` and
   install the AFNI binaries there.

   First, get the install script (*this* command actually works for both
   Fedora and RHEL systems)::
      
      curl -O https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/bin/linux_ubuntu_16_64/@update.afni.binaries
      
   Then install the appropriate AFNI package.  Note that most other
   Linux systems will probably work with linux_openmp_64:

   * *for RHEL 7*::

       tcsh @update.afni.binaries -package linux_openmp_64 -do_extras

   .. note:: if the binary package has already been downloaded, one can use ``-local_package``, followed by the location+name of the binary file, e.g.:

      tcsh @update.afni.binaries -local_package linux_openmp_64.tgz -do_extras

#. **Reboot.**

   Consider a 'reboot' at this point.  That would deal with
   system updates, the change in login shell, and an updated path::

      reboot

#. **Get R setup.**

   Install current R libraries for the group analysis programs.  This
   relies on the environment variable ``$R_LIBS``, which refers to a
   directory that will contain the R packages.  That variable should
   always be set, both to specify where to install the packages and
   where to read them from later (when running R programs).
   Therefore:
      
   * *for setting this variable in* ``tcsh`` 
     *(i.e., if you did* :ref:`tcsh setup, above <setup_FRH_tcsh>`\ *)*::

      setenv R_LIBS $HOME/R
      mkdir $R_LIBS
      echo 'setenv R_LIBS ~/R' >> ~/.cshrc
      rPkgsInstall -pkgs ALL
      
   * *for setting this variable in* ``bash``::
      
       export R_LIBS=$HOME/R
       mkdir $R_LIBS
       echo 'export R_LIBS=$HOME/R' >> ~/.bashrc
       rPkgsInstall -pkgs ALL

   ..
     In order, this has: set (i.e., defined) an environment variable
     called ``$R_LIBS`` to be a subdirectory called "R/" in the user's
     home directory; then made this directory; then written this
     information into the user's ``tcsh`` profile; and finally run an
     AFNI command to (hopefully) get all the necessary R libraries for
     the modern package.


   .. ---------- HERE/BELOW: copy for all installs --------------

#. **Automatically set up AFNI/SUMA profiles.**

   .. include:: substep_profiles.rst

#. **(optional) Prepare for an AFNI Bootcamp.**

   .. include:: substep_bootcamp.rst


#. **EVALUATE THE SETUP: an important and useful step in this
   process!**

   .. include:: substep_evaluate.rst


#. **(optional) Niceifying interfaces: it's a magical terminal.**

   .. include:: substep_rcfiles.rst


#. **Keeping up-to-date (remember).**

   .. include:: substep_update.rst




.. commented out-- older steps, unnecessary here.

   #. **Setting up autoprompts for command line options.**

   The following is quite useful to be set up help files for
   tab-autocompletion of options as you type AFNI commands.  Run this
   command::

     apsearch -update_all_afni_help
      
   and then follow the brief instructions.



    #. **Quick test.**

       Do a quick test to see that afni works::

          afni -ver

       If this doesn't produce anything constructive immediately, or if
       ``reboot`` was skipped, try starting a new ``tcsh`` shell (e.g., by
       opening a new terminal) and updating the path (again, specifically
       for ``tcsh``)::

          tcsh
          set path = ( $path ~/abin )
          rehash
          afni -ver

       | The final command should show something useful, like:
       | ``Precompiled binary linux_ubuntu_12_64: 
         Feb 29 2016 (Version AFNI_16.0.10)``


       NB: ``@update.afni.binaries`` should have set the path in
       ``$HOME/.cshrc`` (when using ``-do_extras``).  Verify this by
       visually checking that the same 'set path' line, above, in the
       (``tcsh``) profile::

         cat ~/.cshrc

       .. am inverting steps 5 and 6 from the original documentation,
          under the idea that hte Bootcamp material is secondary to a
          general install, which I feel should include R.
