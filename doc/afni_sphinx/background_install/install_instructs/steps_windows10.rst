**Windows 10 ('Bash on Ubuntu')**: *The essential system setup*
================================================================

Here we describe installation and system setup for the
recently-available "Bash on Ubuntu" for Windows 10 (BoUoW)
systems. Some general background information information is provided
`in their 'About' page
<https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about>`_.  At
present, the default version of Ubuntu appears to be 16.04.

.. note:: This capability is a very recent development on Windows
          systems, and we are just starting to really test out running
          AFNI and SUMA through it.  Right now, most major
          functionality seems to work, though in some cases graphics
          can be slow.  We would still recommend Linux or Mac systems
          for large-scale processing at this time.

At present, "copy+paste" functionality into the default command window
works a bit awkwardly.  One should be able to copy/paste by selecting
tabs from a drop-down panel in the upper left of the window.  (As part
of the instructions here, a terminal with nicer interface will be
installed.)

Other operating systems allow for either ``tcsh`` or ``bash`` shells
to be run as default in the terminal. *However*, the Windows-Ubuntu
presently does not appear to allow ``tcsh`` as default (perhaps as
forewarned by its descriptive name...), and therefore we describe the
system setup only for staying with ``bash``.

Importantly, as with other installation instructions, you are required
to have administrator privileges on your operating system. 

#. **Install prerequisite: "Bash on Windows."**

   * First, follow the instructions from the first paragraph `HERE
     <https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff629472.aspx>`_ to get 
     Windows PowerShell up and running:

   * Then, follow the instructions `HERE
     <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/install_guide>`_
     to install "Bash on Windows" from Microsoft. (This step, in
     particular, requires having admin privileges to be able to go
     into "developer mode.")
   
   * To install ``bash`` and Ubuntu on Windows: in the lower left of
     the Desktop, click on "Ask me anything" and type::

       cmd

   * In the command window that opens up, type::

       bash

     and the installation continues. Once installed, ``bash`` starts
     the Linux shell.  

   From this point, standard Linux system terminal commands should
   work (e.g., ``ls``, ``cp``, etc.).

   To open up a terminal, you can go to the Search bar in the lower left
   (where it says "Type here to search")
   and start typing "Bash on Ubuntu," and it will likely
   autocomplete while typing.  Additionally, you can make a shortcut
   on your Windows desktop.

#. **Install prerequisite: Xming X Server for Windows.**

   | Click on the following link to start automatic download:
   | `https://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/files/latest/download
     <https://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/files/latest/download>`_

   The default installation settings appear fine.  To set the DISPLAY
   properly in your run-command file, execute the following::

     echo "export DISPLAY=:0.0" >> ~/.bashrc

   When you start up your BoUoW, you will need to double-click on the
   Xming icon in order to start the X Server.  (Sorry, not our
   fault...)

#. **Install prerequisite: AFNI and basic Linux package dependencies.**

   Assuming the version of Ubuntu on your system is Ubuntu 16.04, you
   should now follow the following setup instructions through
   "Automatically set up AFNI/SUMA profiles":
     
   .. list-table:: 
      :header-rows: 0
      :widths: 80

      * - :ref:`Link to Ubuntu 16+ setup instructions for AFNI <install_steps_linux_ubuntu16>`

   **Some things to note.**

   * Again, at present it does not appear possible to change shells to
     ``tcsh``, so that optional step can be skipped.

   * The *R* package installation part might be slow, on the order of
     hours.  Meditation is often a good thing, anyways.

   * You should include the optional ``gnome-terminal`` installation
     in the first set of steps, and then the following odd patch is
     also required::

       sudo sed -i 's/<listen>.*<\/listen>/<listen>tcp:host=localhost,port=0<\/listen>/' /etc/dbus-1/session.conf


#. **(optional) Other tips.**

   * Installation of Ubuntu terminal fonts is described on `this help
     page
     <https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/>`_.

   * ``gnome-terminal`` steps.

     * The default profile "use colors from system theme" shows an
       all-black terminal.  To fix this: select the ``Edit`` tab, then
       ``Profile``, turn **off** "use colors ...", and finally simply
       pick a scheme+palette that you like.

     * In gnome-terminal, everything is standard and similar to other
       linux implementations, and the middle button pastes whatever is
       selected in the BoUoW terminal or other gnome-terminal.
       Shift-Ctrl-c copies, and Shift-Ctrl-v also pastes.

   * Like most Linux systems, some things have to be done with
     ``sudo`` permissions. The username and password may have nothing
     to do with their Windows login. To reset the password, follow
     these instructions:

     * From the default command window, type ``Super[windowskey]+X``,
       then ``A``.  You can change the default user to root::
      
         lxrun /setdefaultuser root

     * Now BoUoW logs you in as root without asking password. Use
       passwd command in Bash to change the user password::

         passwd your_username

     * Change the default user back to your normal user in Windows
       command prompt::

         lxrun /setdefaultuser your_username
