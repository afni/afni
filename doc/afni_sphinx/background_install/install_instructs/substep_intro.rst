**For each step**, either:
 A. copy+paste commands from the green fields into the terminal
    (:ref:`help and shortcuts here <U_misc_copypaste>`), or
 #. click on a link to download+install a package.

**We assume** the user has admin privileges (can run ``sudo
...``). Some steps require an internet connection. Some steps depend
on the OS version.

**To find out what shell** you are using (e.g., ``bash`` or ``tcsh``),
type::

  echo $0

**IMPORTANT:** Please:
 i. Do all steps.
 #. Run ``afni_system_check.py -check_all`` in the "Evaluate" stage.
 #. *And* follow the system check recommendations in the output
    "Please Fix" section.
