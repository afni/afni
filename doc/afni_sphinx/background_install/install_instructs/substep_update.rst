From this point onward, you can easily keep your AFNI uptodate just
by running a single command::

  @update.afni.binaries -d

That's it!! It will automatically download the correct latest version
to your computer, replacing your old binaries. 

| *Q: When should you update?*
| *A: Often! You don't want to be left behind, do you?*

You can always check your version by typing::

  afni -ver

(And you should always check and report your version if you have
questions/comments/etc.)

.. note:: The record of changes (new options, new programs, bug fixes,
          et al.) is maintained for all the see in the online `AFNI
          History
