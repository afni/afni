Overview
========

There are a few modes/varieties/flavors of fiber tracking which can be
performed with ``3dTrackID``.  Selecting which one to use depends a
bit on the available inputs (though, these are mostly the same for
each mode) and on the desired outcome ("with great power comes great
responsibility").

A general theme of all of them is to be able to deal with the
following scenario: *I have a network of target ROIs; where is the
most likely location of the white matter connecting any of them, and
what quantitative properties do those white matter ROIs have?*

Excited? Me, too.  Before continuing, though, let's agree on some
terminology with which these help pages will hopefully show
consistency:

#. The set of things among which we want to find connections are
   referred to as **target ROIs** or just **targets**, and
   collectively as the **network of targets**.  There are usually
   *N>1* targets in a network, but sometimes it is useful to use a
   wholebrain mask as a 'network of one' for viewing tracts. Each
   target is a set of voxels of a particular nonzero integer, and we
   may refer to it either by the name of the integer or by a label
   associated with that integer (e.g., "1" is the "precuneus",
   etc.). The use of ``3dROIMaker`` in forming target networks is
   described in :ref:`Making_ROIs`.

#. The set of tracts connecting a given pair of targets is called a
   **bundle**. These are specifically the collection of linear
   structures themselves. Heck, sometimes we'll abandon all formality
   and just call them 'tracts', as well.

#. The volume containing a particular bundle is called a **WM
   ROI**. This refers to the *set of voxels* containing the particular
   tracts of interest between targets. We try to keep the terminology
   distinct from the set of target ROIs to avoid confusion.

#. Bundles and WM ROIs can be made use **AND**\ -logic and/or
   **OR**\ -logic (enough conjunctions in that statement for you?):

   * **AND**\ -logic means connecting two distinct targets, such as
     (target) ROI 4 and ROI 5; in output files, these types of
     connections are grouped under the name **PAIR** or **PAIRMAP**
     (for "pairwise" target bundles). NB: a PAIR tract could pass
     through a third target as well, but it doesn't matter at all for
     labeling or its definition as an AND-logic connection.
   * **OR**\ -logic means passing through at least one specific
     target, such as target ROI 2, with the possibility (but not the
     necessity) of passing through any other target(s); in output
     files, these types of connections are grouped under the name
     **INDI** or **INDIMAP** (for 'individual' target bundles). NB:
     for purely notational and labelling purposes, it's also
     convenient to think of an INDI bundle being the special case of
     connecting a target with itself-- this is useful for the
     matrix-style storing of information described in the next list
     item.
   * the PAIR tracts/bundles and WM ROIs are a subset of INDI ones.

#. Tracking to determine the *structural* connectivity among
   pairs/individual targets is analogous to using correlation to
   determine *functional* connectivity among a (target)
   network. Functional connectivity information is generally stored
   and viewed as correlation matrices, and we borrow the same to store
   ``3dTrackID`` output in **structural connectivity matrices**:

   * a given matrix can store properties such as the number of tracts
     between two targets, the average FA of a WM ROI, etc.
   * just as in a correlation matrix, each row and column is labeled
     by a particular target. Each **element** of the matrix contains
     the property of the WM ROI that connects those targets.
   * a diagonal matrix element, where the row number is the same as
     the wcolumn number, describes a property of an OR-logic (or INDI)
     WM ROI.
   * an off-diagonal element describes a property of an AND-logic (or
     PAIR) WM ROI.
   * the structural connectivity matrix is symmetric: the property
     between targets 1 and 7 is the same as that between targets 7 and
     1 (and similarly for any off-diagonal element). This is another
     way of stating that there is no directionality between the
     structural connectivity properties.
  

.. note:: "All targets are equal," meaning that tracking is performed
          amongst and within the network of targets, with no special
          preference.  Other programs may have an approach of tracking
          'to' a target 'from' a seed, but this directional approach
          (where "some targets are more equal than others") is not the
          philosphical choice here. Why should a tract result
          connecting targets 1 and 9 be different than that connecting
          9 and 1?

Modus operandi
==============

**Preface.** Once upon a time, there were two separate FATCAT programs
for performing deterministic and probabilistic tractography (3dTrackID
and 3dProbTrackID, respectively), as described in the initial paper
(Taylor and Saad, 2013). Soon after this introduction, it became
apparent that there could be only one.  After a brief quickening,
3dTrackID picked up the probabilistic attributes and now that program
is run in separate modes. Which brings us to the present.

**Current times.** There are three distinct **modes** for performing
 tractography, and each is denoted with a short string after the
 required switch ``-mode *``.  These are:

 #. deterministic (``DET``),
   
 #. mini-probabilistic (``MINIP``), 

 #. (full) probabilistic (``PROB``).

Thus, all FATCAT tracking commands will start with a selection of one
of these modes::
  
  3dTrackID -mode {DET|MINIP|PROB} ...

There is a lot of overlap in what kind of data are input and output
for these modes. First, we describe the default and optional outputs
of all; then, special outputs of some; finally, the differences in
inputs (and why they exist as such).

The outputs can be viewed variously and interactively in AFNI and SUMA
(such as for volume, tract, and dset files).  Additionally, matrices
of properties can be viewed and saved from the command line with some
``fat_*.py`` functions. Finally, outputs can be used for quantitative
comparison and statistical modeling-- one method for doing the latter
exists using G. Chen's 3dMVM (see below for some description, and the
FATMVM demo introduced :ref:`DEMO_Definitions`).

.. _Tract_Out:

Outputs common to all modes
===========================

#. By default, each of the ``3dTrackID`` modes will output the following:

   * volumes of WM ROIs, both a single **PAIRMAP** file of the AND-logic
     connections and a single **INDIMAP** file of the OR-logic ones.
     These can be viewed most easily using the AFNI viewer to get a
     visualization of:

     * all the locations where tracts went through the network ([0]th brick
       of either MAP file);

     * all the locations where tracts went through an individual target
       ([i]th brick of either MAP file, where *i>0*);

   * a **grid** file (ending with ``*.grid``), which contains all the
     structural connectivity matrices for the given
     network. Quantities include both mean and standard deviation of
     DTI parameters (FA, MD, L1 and RD), as well as the volume of the
     WM ROIs (both in terms of physical units, number of voxels, and
     volume scaled by whole brain mask), as well as the number of
     tracts. The matrices in these files can be:

     * selected, viewed and saved to an image file using
       ``fat_mat_sel.py``;

     * used for group-based statistics with G. Chen's 3dMVM program,
       with some helper ``fat_mvm*.py`` functions available for
       putting everything together and building commands+models.

   * a **dset** file (ending with ``*.dset``), which also contains all
     of the structural connectivity matrices for a given network.
     Matrices in these files can be:

     * loaded into SUMA (``$ suma -gdset NAME.niml.dset ...``);

     * viewed in SUMA as either a standard, colorful matrix, or as a
       graph-like network of nodes and edges throughout the 3D brain
       representation;


   **Example 1.** For example, running ``3dTrackID`` with ``-prefix
   o.NETS`` (and ``-nifti``) will produce the output files::

     o.NETS_000.grid
     o.NETS_000.niml.dset
     o.NETS_000_INDIMAP.nii.gz
     o.NETS_000_PAIRMAP.nii.gz

   Comments on these outputs:

     * A PAIRMAP is not output if the input network has only one
       target ROI, such as if one is doing a simple whole brain
       tracking.

     * One can turn off INDIMAP and PAIRMAP output altogether, using
       the switch ``-no_indipair_out``.  This might be useful if you
       are tracking through a *large* network of targets (for example,
       something connectome-y) and don't want to risk having a single
       reaaally big output file wasting space or causing trouble.

     * By default, all volumetric outputs (PAIRMAP, INDIMAP,
       ``-dump_rois *`` files, etc.) are in BRIK/HEAD file format.  If
       you prefer NIFTI, you can use the switch ``-nifti`` to get all
       "\*.nii.gz" files.

   |

#. Additionally, each mode *can* also output:

   * a set of maps/masks of each individual WM ROI. This is done using
     the option ``-dump_rois {AFNI|DUMP|BOTH|AFNI_MAP}``. The keyword
     options each produces a set of individual files of the following:

     * ``DUMP`` -> ``3dmaskdump``\-like text files of each WM ROI
       (which could take quite a lot of space and not be so useful;
    
     * ``AFNI`` -> binary masks of each WM ROI;
    
     * ``BOTH`` -> both the binary masks and text files (combined
       outputs of ``DUMP`` and ``AFNI``; the name reflects that it was
       developed when there were only two individual output formats);
    
     * ``AFNI_MAP`` --> non-binarized *maps* of each WM ROI, where the
       value of each voxel is the number of tracts that went through
       it for that given connection;

     **Example 1 (continued).** Additionally, if one also included the
     command ``-dump_rois AFNI``, then the output would include a
     directory **o.NETS/** with the following files, such as::

       NET_000_ROI_001_001.nii.gz  
       NET_000_ROI_001_004.nii.gz  
       NET_000_ROI_002_002.nii.gz  
       NET_000_ROI_002_003.nii.gz  
       NET_000_ROI_002_004.nii.gz  
       NET_000_ROI_002_006.nii.gz  
       NET_000_ROI_002_007.nii.gz  
       ...

     With the specific dump option used here, each file would contain
     a binary mask of the given WM connection.  The file naming
     convention is: NET_X_ROI_Y_Z.nii.gz, where:

       * 'X' is the number of the network (because multiple ones can
         be tracked simultaneously

       * 'Y' is the number or label of a target ROI
     
       * 'Z' is the number or label of another target ROI

     The files where 'Y'=='Z' contain INDIMAP information of a target,
     and the others where not('Y'=='Z') contain PAIRMAPs.  It's
     important to note that tracts will not be found between every
     possible pair of targets, and so not every possible pairwise
     combination will have a file output.  |

     .. note:: Probably using one of the options ``-dump_rois
               {AFNI|AFNI_MAP}`` would be the most useful.  Some
               unnamed user(s) would even go so far as to recommend
               using it all the time, because either would provide the
               only unambiguous maps of individual WM ROIs output by
               ``3dTrackID``.

   * A labeltable file (``*.niml.lt``) will also be output if one has
     been attached to the input network file. While one might not view
     this on its own, having a labeltable set up can be very useful,
     for example in helping to discuss specific bundles by the
     anatomical locations they connect.

   |

Outputs specific to ``{DET|MINIP}`` modes
=========================================

#. The outputs in the previous section are output for all modes of
   ``3dTrackID``.  However, careful readers will note that none of
   those tractographic outputs actually contained the tracts
   themselves!  These are only output in ``{DET|MINIP}`` modes, as the
   following:

   * a **tract** file (ending with ``*.tract``), which contains all
     the individual tract sequences.  Additionally, it internally has
     the tracts organized into sets of bundles between targets, so
     that each bundle could be displayed as a separate color.  These
     files are viewable in SUMA, loading with::

       suma -tract PREFIX.niml.tract ...

     One can also load in the **dset** simultaneously and view the
     connectivity matrix elements as coloration of tract bundles, such
     as after::

       suma -tract PREFIX.niml.tract  -gdset PREFIX.niml.dset ...

     (In fact, the dset loaded in could be either one output by
     ``3dTrackID`` or by ``3dNetCorr``.)

   * a TRK-format file, ``*.trk``, legacy of when tractographic output
     had to be viewed with non-AFNI/SUMA options, which in this case
     were with TrackVis.  These are not output by default. To have
     these be output, use the the ``-do_trk_out`` switch.

#. When outputting tract files, one has to choose whether to use
   AND-logic or OR-logic within the network.  That is, whether to keep
   tracts that have a minimal requirement of going through one target
   (OR), or whether to require at tract to connect at least two
   targets (AND).  The choice is made using the (required) option
   ``-logic {AND|OR}``.

#. And, just to state explicitly, the full probabilistic tracking in
   ``-mode PROB`` does *not* (currently) produce tract file output.
   Such is life and also an impetus behind the mini-probabilistic
   methodology (described further below).
   
|

Viewing tracked outputs
=======================

Many different types of output files can be viewed simultaneously in
SUMA (volume, tractfile, dset/matrices, etc.).  SUMA and AFNI can also
be run at the same time to talk together and share informative gossip
on data sets.  All the individual SUMA examples below can be combined
in a single command line call.  After opening a controller, you can
hit the new useful 'All Objs.' button near the top, in order to
*immediately* be able to toggle among each input file.  For more
information on SUMA viewing in general, check out :ref:`viewer`.

#. **Volume files outputs.** PAIRMAP, INDIMAP and dumped volumes can
   all be viewed in either AFNI or in SUMA.  To load them into the
   latter for 3D visualization, use::
    
     suma -vol FILENAME ...
     
   By default, they are displayed as slices and not as surfaces, but
   you can select that capability (see description in
   :ref:`Volume_Viewing`).

   To view the volume files in the 2D afni slice viewer, one uses the
   standard, general call to open AFNI (assuming you're in a directory
   where those files are located; otherwise, include the path to
   them)::
     
     afni

#. **Matrix file outputs.** SUMA is used to view the matrix
   information in the ``*.dset`` file.  While one can view this
   information as a 'classic' connectivity matrix (for both
   ``3dTrackID`` and ``3dNetCorr`` outputs), it is also possible to
   view the data as coloration of graph edges and/or tract bundles in
   the brain volume. For more features, please see the help examples
   in SUMA: :ref:`Graph_Viewing`. To load the data into SUMA, use::

     suma -gdset FILE.niml.dset ...

   Additionally, one can select, view and save the matrices from the
   command line with a Python-based tool, ``fat_mat_sel.py``.  This
   program can output several matrices from several subjects
   simultaneously, and the user can control several features of the
   plotting (font size, colorbar properties, ranges, DPI, etc.). It
   can be useful, for example, when making outputs for presentations
   and publications.  See the helpfile::
     
     fat_mat_sel.py -h

   for more information and list of the options.

#. **Tract files.** These are viewable in SUMA with *many, many*
   interactive features.  To load in the tracts::

     suma -tract FILE.niml.tract ...
     
   Default coloration is by local tract orientation, but one can also
   color, for example, by bundle (useful for connectomes) or by the
   connectivity matrix information (importing the ``-gdset
   FILE.niml.dset`` information, above). 

   Selection masks (either sphere or box) can be made for specifying
   subsets of tracts. One can have multiple selection masks, and use
   AND- and/or OR-logic with them. **Importantly**, these volumes are
   dragged along the tracts and bundles themselves, so that one can
   follow arbitrary trajectories through 3D (i.e., one is not
   constrained to manipulating them just in 2D slices).  

   For more information, please see the voluminous set of features,
   hints and examples in the SUMA help: :ref:`Tract_Viewing`.

#. **TRK files.** These ``NAME.trk`` files are generated using the
   TrackVis format, and as such can be viewed in the eponymous
   program. (They are not output by default.)

.. _Inp_Track:

Inputs for tracking
===================

This section will be an attempt to cluster 3dTrackID input options
meaningfully.

.. _Min_Inp_Track:

Minimal inputs for each mode
----------------------------

Each option is briefly explained the first time it is mentioned; one
can assume that, unless explicitly noted, the initial definition still
holds. A selection of ``-mode {DET|MINIP|PROB}`` is always required,
as well.

The examples are shown for DTI tracking, and the simple option change
in each case for performing HARDI tracking is provided immediately
after.

#. Deterministic (DET) DTI::

     3dTrackID -mode DET            \
         -dti_in  DT_PREF           \
         -netrois TARGET_ROI_FILE   \
         -logic   {AND|OR}          \
         -prefix  OUT_PREF
   
   where:
   
   * ``-dti_in DT_PREF``: point to the set of DTI parameter files by
     their prefix.  The program will read in all scalar files with
     this prefix and output WM ROI statistics on them. The minimum set
     of files needed for tracking is: 

     * (scalar) FA, MD and L1-- RD is calculated automatically if it's
       not loaded in

     * (vector) V1, V2 and V3

     The function will glob for all scalar files with the entered
     prefix (``-dti_in DT_PREF`` leads to searching for file names
     like 'DT_PREF*'), so other scalars can be easily included for
     automatic connectivity matrix calculation by giving them the same
     prefix. (See below for other ways of including extra files.)

   * ``-netrois TARGET_ROI_FILE``: input the file of targets among
     which to find connections. This can be a file with multiple
     volumes/bricks, and each brick is treated like a separate
     network. Each target in a network is defined as a set of voxels
     with a given integer, and a labletable can be attached for
     further target naming with strings (with the labels also being
     attached to tracked outputs).

   * ``-logic {AND|OR}``: select whether the tracts output in the
     *.tract file connect targets using AND- or OR-logic. NB: in
     *either case, both INDI and PAIR map (volume) files are output.

   * ``-prefix OUT_PREF``: prefix for all output files, as described
     above. Additionally, a network number will be appended before the
     file extensions, starting with 000, 001, 002, etc. (in order to
     match the brick number of the ``-netrois`` file).

   .. note:: Instead of ``-dti_in DT_PREF``, one can input an explicit
             file of list of DTI parameter files to input in a
             niml-formatted text file with ``-dti_list
             FILE.niml.opts``. An example is provided in the 3dTrackID
             help file under "DTI LIST FILE EXAMPLE". Up to 4 'extra'
             scalar-valued files can be input for statistical purposes.

   |

#. Mini-probabilistic (MINIP) DTI::

     3dTrackID -mode MINIP          \
         -dti_in  DT_PREF           \
         -netrois TARGET_ROI_FILE   \
         -logic   {AND|OR}          \
         -uncert  U_FILE            \
         -mini_num NREP             \
         -prefix  OUT_PREF

   where:

   * ``-uncert UNCERT_FILE``: the file of uncertainty values output by
     3dDWUncert.
     
   * ``-mini_num NREP``: the number of perturbed Monte Carlo
     repetitions to perform.  Often 5-7 seems to be a good number.

     |

#. Fully probabilistic (PROB) DTI::

     3dTrackID -mode PROB           \
         -dti_in  DT_PREF           \
         -netrois TARGET_ROI_FILE   \
         -uncert  U_FILE            \
         -prefix  OUT_PREF

   where: all the options have been described in the previous two
   examples! (This method produces no tract results, however, just
   volumes.  But those can be quite useful, too.)

   |

#. Performing HARDI tracking in each of the above cases is done with a
   change of one option:
   
   * Replace ``-dti_in DT_PREF`` (or ``-dti_list FILE.niml.opts``)
     with:

     * ``-hardi_gfa GFA``: the scalar map which you want to be
       thresholded to contrain the propagation (that is, a
       generalization of what the FA map typically does for DTI
       tracking);

     * ``-hardi_dirs DIRS``: the file of vectors in X>1 directions.
       The assumed format of FILE2 is to have 3*X bricks of (x1, y1,
       z1, x2, y2, z2, ...) ordered, unit magnitude vector components.

   * Also, note that when using HARDI data for either MINIP or PROB
     tracking, then the uncertainty file must have a different format
     than the one output by 3dDWUncert for DTI tracking. It must have
     X+1 briks, where U_FILE[0] is the uncertainty for the GFA
     (scalar) file, and the other briks are ordered for directions
     given with the DIRS file (vectors; uncertainty in this case is
     characterized by a single angle, sweeping out a cone of
     uncertainty).

   |

Including extra volumes
-----------------------

#. One might want to load extra volumes of information into
   ``3dTrackID`` for making extra connectivity matrices in the output
   *.grid files. For example, one might want statistics performed on
   non-diffusion data such as T1 or PD values.

   * If using ``-dti_in DT_PREF``, one can give these files the same
     prefix, so that they are found using the glob for 'DT_PREF*'
     filenames.

   * If using ``-dti_list FILE.niml.opts``, one can enter the other
     filenames directly (without special prefix), in the
     NIML-formatted file; see the second example under "DTI LIST FILE
     EXAMPLE" in the 3dTrackID help.

   * For the HARDI data case, one can input a prefix using
     ``-hardi_pars PREF`` and glob for all single brick files with the
     name 'PREF*'.

#. Alternatively, in DTI analysis one *might* want to use a non-FA map
   to restrict tract propagation, for example using a T1-weighted
   segmentation. For this purpose, one would load it in using
   ``-dti_extra SET``. In grid files, name of this quantity will be
   'XF' (stands for 'extra file'). 

   NB: if the file ``SET`` happens to have a name like 'DT_PREF*', it
   will still be globbed for using ``-dti_in DT_PREF``, and therefore
   included twice. But that shouldn't harm any results.

   .. note:: To turn *off* the globbing capability (beyond finding
             just the bare minimum DTI files), one can use
             the ``-dti_search_NO`` switch.

Including tract masks
---------------------

#. One can restrict *all* tracts to lie within a mask using ``-mask
   MASK``.  (If no MASK is input, then internally some automasking is
   performed; often, DTI has already been masked to include just the
   whole brain, which would then be used as the internal mask.)

#. Alternatively, if you want to allow tracts anywhere in the brain
   but to keep only those which pass *through* a particular region,
   then you can load that region in as a "thru-mask" with ``-thru_mask
   TM``.

#. And, though it's not a separate option, if you want to make an
   "anti-mask" region through which tracts are *not* allowed to go,
   you can give that region negative values in the particular network
   loaded in with ``-netrois TARGET_ROI_FILE``.

Changing default tracking parameters
------------------------------------

#. The following major tracking parameters can all be changed
   individually from the command line (default values are given):

   * for *all* modes:

     ``-alg_Thresh_FA A`` : set threshold for DTI FA map, '-dti_extra'
     FILE, or HARDI GFA map (default = 0.2).

     ``-alg_Thresh_ANG B`` : set max angle (in deg) for turning when
     going to a new voxel during propagation (default = 60).

     ``-alg_Thresh_Len C`` : min physical length (in mm) of tracts to
     keep (default = 20).

   * for ``{DET|MINIP}`` modes:

     ``-alg_Nseed_X D`` : Number of seeds per vox in x-direc (default
     = 2).

     ``-alg_Nseed_Y E`` : Number of seeds per vox in y-direc (default
     = 2).

     ``-alg_Nseed_Z F`` : Number of seeds per vox in z-direc (default
     = 2).
    
   * for ``PROB`` mode:

     ``-alg_Thresh_Frac G`` : value for thresholding how many tracks
     must pass through a voxel for a given connection before it is
     included in the final WM-ROI of that connection.  It is a decimal
     value <=1, which will multiply the number of 'starting seeds' per
     voxel, Nseed_Vox*Nmonte (see just below for those; default =
     0.001; for higher specificity, a value of 0.01-0.05 would be
     used).

     ``-alg_Nseed_Vox H`` : number of seeds per voxel per Monte Carlo
     iteration; seeds will be placed randomly (default = 5).

     ``-alg_Nmonte I`` : number of Monte Carlo iterations (default =
     1000).

#. The above ``alg_*`` tracking parameters can also be set at once in
   a single text file.  The text file can either have only plain text
   and no labels, or it can be in NIML-format with nice labels so that
   there's no confusion about which value is being set. See the
   ``3dTrackID`` help file's "ALGOPT FILE EXAMPLES" for more
   information.  The option file is loaded in using ``-algopt
   A_FILE``.

#. When in MINIP and PROB modes, which use the uncertainty of
   parameter values, one can choose an explicit minimum uncertainty;
   in general, the uncertainty files will have been generated using
   ``3dDWUncert``, but for whatever reason you might want to enforce a
   minimal angular uncertainty or something. The values are set with:

   ``-unc_min_FA VAL1`` : the minimum stdev for perturbing FA (in
   ``-dti_in``), or the EXTRA- file also in DTI (``-dti_extra``), or
   GFA (in ``-hardi_*``).  Default value is: 0.015 for FA, and 0.015
   times the max value in the EXTRA-file or in the GFA file.

   ``-unc_min_V VAL2`` : the minimum stdev for perturbing
   eigen-/direction-vectors.  In DTI, this is for tipping V1
   separately toward V2 and V3, and in HARDI, this is for defining a
   single degree of freedom uncertainty cone. Default values are
   0.06 rad (~3.4 deg) for any eigenvector/direction. User assigns
   values in degrees.

Thresholding ``{DET|MINIP}`` bundles by tract count
---------------------------------------------------

The PROB method requires a certain number of tracts to go through a
voxel before it is included in a WM ROI connection.

Recently, the ability to trim some kinds of 'obvious' noisy tracts
from DET and MINIP modes has been added.  The option ``-bundle_thr V``
allows the user to enter a minimum threshold number of tracts for
any bundle to have without being filtered out (AKA removed).

It is based on the fact that occasionally, one will see an odd tract
winding as a connection between two targets, in what would appear
visually to be an outlier. Even when using more DET seeds or MINIP
iterations, the tract might remain isolated-- further justifying its
interpretation as noise-driven.  The bundle threshold criterion can be
useful in removing it easily.

Note, however, that the fully probabilistic mode's criterion is
stricter, and it still provides the most robust results when tracking.

Using target surfaces to control tract trimming
-----------------------------------------------

In each iteration of ``3dTrackID``, an initial set of all possible
tracts throughout the brain are generated, tracking forward and
backward as far as the stopping conditions allow from seeds in every
WM voxel (such as where FA>0.2).  A network map is then "stamped"
down, and any tracts that intersect targets are kept (with the others
temporarily ignored).  For connections between pairs of targets, once
can decide how much of the initial tract constitutes a connection.  

The :ref:`figure <fig_tract_trimming>` below demonstrates the four
current possibilities (AFNI version >=16.3.09). It could be:

A. Default: only the parts of the tract within and between the targets;
   that is, parts of the initial tract that stick out away from the
   partner target are ignored.

#. ``-uncut_at_rois``: The whole initial tract: parts of the tract
   within each target, between the targets, *and* those endparts
   sticking out away from each target.

#. ``-targ_surf_stop``: only parts of the tract between the targets and
   just **one layer into** the target volumes; that is, the target
   surface stops the tracts after they enter.

#. ``-targ_surf_twixt``: only parts of the tract between the targets,
   stopping just **just outside of** the target volumes; that is, the
   tracts are only between (= betwixt) the targets, not overlapping at
   all.  

Each of these approaches applies to any mode of tracking (``DET``,
``MINIP`` or ``PROB``).  Also, each approach only refers to the
AND-logic (= pairwise; the off-diagonal elements of the returned
matrix of structural properties) connections between two targets; the
OR-logic tracts (the on-diagonal elements in the matrix of structural
properties) that are defined by going through at least a single target
are unaffected (those are always untrimmed).

.. note:: Note that for the ``-targ_surf_*`` cases, a tract between
          targets A and B *could* overlap/pass through a separate
          target C, though; the restriction on a tract's overlap only
          refers to the two targets it connects. Separate tracts from
          A to C and from B to C would obey specified surface-stopping
          rules with those respective targets.

Using SUMA for visualization (sagittal view, FA slice as background),
the above :ref:`figure <fig_tract_trimming>` shows two targets
(represented as magenta and orange meshes) and various ways that the
AND-logic, pairwise connection tracts for them could be returned.


Useful output dumping of WM ROIs
--------------------------------

See the ``-dump_rois *`` option above in :ref:`Tract_Out`.  I think
it's pretty valuable to use one of ``-dump_rois {AFNI|AFNI_MAP}``, in
order to be able to have individual WM ROI files output. The PAIR and
INDI maps are mostly for quick reference, in my opinion, while the
dumped files can be more useful in viewing or further quantitative
analyses.

Switching various features ON/OFF
---------------------------------

* ``-do_trk_out`` : *do* output *.trk files, which might be useful in
  other, non-AFNI/SUMA programs.

* ``-uncut_at_rois`` : by default, tracts connecting pairs of targets
  are restricted to lie within and between the targets-- if a tract
  carries on through the other side, that part is *cut* and not
  recorded as part of the pair's 'connection'.  If you don't want this
  trimming process to occur, then use this switch.

* ``-no_indipair_out`` : choose to *not* output a PAIR and INDI map.
  Might be useful to save space if one has a lot of targets in a
  network.  On could utilize this switch and then just use the
  ``-dump_rois *`` option, as well.

* ``-write_opts`` : output a NIML-formatted file of the algorithm
  options being used.  Might be useful if you want to keep it around
  to use later or as a record.

* ``-write_rois`` : write out a file (PREFIX.roi.labs) of all the ROI
  (re-)labels, for example if the input ROIs aren't simply consecutive
  and starting from 1. The file has three cols: Input_ROI,
  Condensed_form_ROI, Power_of_2_label.

* ``-dump_no_labtab`` : if the ROIS file has a label table, the
  default is to use it in naming a ``-dump_rois *`` output (if being
  used); using this switch turn that off-- output file names will be
  the same as if no label table were present.

Miscellaneous others
--------------------

* ``-nifti`` : output all volume files as ``*.nii.gz`` files.

* ``-extra_tr_par`` : run three extra track parameter scalings for
  each target pair, output in the *.grid file. The NT value of each
  connection is scaled in the following manners for each subsequent
  matrix label:

  * *NTpTarVol*: div. by average target volume;

  * *NTpTarSA*: div. by average target surface area;

  * *NTpTarSAFA*: div. by average target surface area bordering
    suprathreshold FA (or equivalent WM proxy definition).

  NB: the volume and surface area numbers are given in terms of voxel
  counts and not using physical units (consistent: NT values themselves
  are just numbers.)

* Sundry other options described in the ``3dTrackID`` helpfile (which
  most likely aren't interesting enough to describe further):
  '-dump_lab_consec', '-posteriori', '-rec_orig' and '-pair_out_power'.
