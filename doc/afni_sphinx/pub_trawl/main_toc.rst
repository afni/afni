Pub trawl
=========

Below is an archive of "larger" AFNI commands that have been used in
published work, largely grouped by category of processing.  We thank
the authors who have kindly agreed to put their AFNI processing
commands and/or scripts onto the interweb for public reference and
use.  These take the guess work out of translating a paper's Methods
section into a command and provide a good starting point for building
your *own* scripts with AFNI. 

For each set of examples, there is a "brief" description, that is
meant to be scannable and searchable by keyword; links to the papers
and scripts are provided. Each entry also a link to the "detailed"
description, where the codes can be viewed directly.

Scripts and commands may be provided in simplified/basic form. One can
also expect that file names or any other identifying information has
been removed, relabelled, recoded, etc.  We will try to make such
instances obvious.

We fully expect that developments in the field will continue to push
processing techniques forward, and therefore preferred processing
steps will assuredly change over time.  We will try to note these
cases and their rationales when possible.  

We are always (well, *usually*) happy to answer questions via the AFNI
`Message Board <https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/afni/community/board/>`_,
and hopefully these scripts further the discussion.
