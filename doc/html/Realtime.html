<h2><b>How to Program Realtime AFNI</b></h2>

The <i>AFNI</i> realtime plugin will assemble reconstructed slices
or volumes into a 3D or 3D+time dataset. It does <i>not</i> do
image reconstruction itself, but requires an <i>image source</i>.
This is the documentation on how to write such an image source
program.
<hr noshade="noshade" />
<h2>Sample Program</h2>
The program <b><tt>rtfeedme.c</tt></b> (part of the <i>AFNI</i>
source code distribution) will take a pre-existing <i>AFNI</i>
dataset, take it apart, and transmit it to the realtime plugin for
reassembly and other processing. This software can be used as a
starting point for development of a new program.
<p><b><u>Using rtfeedme with <i>AFNI</i></u></b><br />
This simulation of realtime acquisition was written largely for
testing purposes. The steps to use it are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start <i>AFNI</i> with the command<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; <tt><b>afni -rt</b></tt><br />
(the <b><tt>-rt</tt></b> switch enables the realtime plugin).</li>
<li>Use the <b><tt>Datamode-&gt;Plugins</tt></b> menu to start the
<b><tt>RT&nbsp;Options</tt></b> plugin, which lets you control how
various things happen during realtime acquisition.</li>
<li>Choose an existing dataset (say <tt><b>fred+orig</b></tt>), and
send it to <i>AFNI</i> with the command<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; <tt><b>rfteedme -dt 30 fred+orig</b></tt></li>
</ol>
<i>rtfeedme</i> is not compiled by default with the rest of the
<i>AFNI</i> package; if you have acquired the source code package, then
you can compile this program with the command &nbsp;
<b><tt>make&nbsp;rtfeedme</tt></b>&nbsp;.
<hr noshade="noshade" />
<h2>Hosts that <i>AFNI</i> Trusts</h2>
If you want to try using <i>rtfeedme</i> from a different system,
and send data across the network, the command to do this would
be<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; <b><tt>rfteedme -dt 30 -hostname afnicomputername
fred+orig</tt></b><br />
However, <i>AFNI</i> won't accept a TCP/IP connection from just
anyone.
<p><i>AFNI</i> checks the incoming IP address of socket connections
to see if the host is on the "trust list". The default trust list
is</p>
<pre>
   <b>127.0.0.1</b> = localhost
<b>192.168</b>   = private class B networks (this is a reserved set of
               addresses that should not be visible to the Internet)
</pre>
You can add to this list by defining the environment variable as in
the example below (before starting <i>AFNI</i>):
<pre>
<b>  setenv AFNI_TRUSTHOST 123.45.67
</b>
</pre>
This means that any IP address starting with the above string will
be acceptable. If you want to add more than one possibility, then
you can also use environment variables
<b><tt>AFNI_TRUSTHOST_1</tt></b>, <b><tt>AFNI_TRUSTHOST_2</tt></b>,
up to <b><tt>AFNI_TRUSTHOST_99</tt></b>. (That should be enough -
how trusting do you really want to be?) You can also use hostnames
(but not network names) in a <b><tt>AFNI_TRUSTHOST</tt></b>
environment variable, but the IP address method is surer to work.
<p>A number of other environment variables can control how the
realtime plugin operates. See the text file <a href=
"http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/src/README.environment">README.environment</a> for the
details.</p>

<h2>Structure of a Realtime Image Source</h2>
There are several steps that an image source must take to get the
communications with <i>AFNI</i> established:
<ol>
<li><font color="#BB0000"><b>Open the Control
Channel</b></font><br />
The only information that is sent down the control channel is the
description of how the actual data will be transmitted (i.e.,
describe the data channel). After this is done, the control channel
should be closed by the image source.</li>
<li><font color="#BB0000"><b>Open the Data Channel</b></font><br />
This is the communication pathway that will be used to send image
data and metadata from the image source program to <i>AFNI</i>.
<ul>
<li>N.B.: The control and data channels are one-way. They only send
bytes to <i>AFNI</i>; no data is transmitted backwards to the image
source. (However, the image source should detect if the control
channel or data channel is closed abnormally, to be able to recover
from the unlikely event of an <i>AFNI</i> crash.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><font color="#BB0000"><b>Send Image Metadata</b></font><br />
This information describes the format of the images that are about
to be sent.</li>
<li><font color="#BB0000"><b>Send Image Data</b></font><br />
This is done as much as desired. When the data channel is broken,
<i>AFNI</i> will write the new dataset to disk.
<ul>
<li>After the image metadata is sent, <i>AFNI</i> reads data in
chunks of a whole image (2D or 3D, depending on
<tt>ACQUISITION_TYPE</tt>). If the image source program sends only
part of an image, then <i>AFNI</i> will freeze, waiting for the
rest of that image's data bytes. The only exception this rule is if
the image source does something to close the data channel (e.g.,
crashes). Note that if the image source computer itself crashes,
<i>AFNI</i> may not be notified that the socket has gone bad (this
is a flaw in TCP/IP); in this case <i>AFNI</i> may hang forever.
(I've never seen this happen, so don't obsess about it.)</li>
<li><b>[11 Dec 2002]</b> It used to be true that the only way for
the image source to finalize the dataset(s) under construction
inside <i>AFNI</i> was to close the data channel. To send another
dataset would then require reopening the control channel, etc.
However, it is now possible to send a message down the data channel
that will close the current dataset(s) and leave the data channel
open. After that message is sent, the next data sent should be a
new set of image metadata, followed by the images for the new
datasets.
<p>The "terminate dataset" message must be sent as a full-size
image of the size that <i>AFNI</i> is expecting. For example, if
you are sending 64x64 2D slices of shorts, <i>AFNI</i> reads image
data in chunks of 8192 (64x64x2) bytes. The first 30 bytes of this
data are used as the termination message; the rest of this data
will be ignored. The message string is (without the quotes):</p>
<blockquote>"<b>Et Earello Endorenna utulien!!</b>"</blockquote>
This string is defined by the macro <tt>COMMAND_MARKER</tt> in
plug_realtime.c and rtfeedme.c.
<ul>
<li>It is my opinion that this sequence of bytes is unlikely to
occur in actual image data. If this supposition proves incorrect,
please let me know by writing out the details in the margin of a
US$100 bill (or several, if you need the space) and mailing it (or
them) to me.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Communicating with <i>AFNI</i></h2>
<font color="#BB0000"><u><b>IOCHANs</b></u></font><br />
An external program talks to the realtime plugin using an abstract
communication device called an "IOCHAN". An IOCHAN can either be a
TCP/IP socket or a shared memory segment; the former would be used
for communicating between computers and the latter for
communicating within a single system. These routines are
implemented in the files <tt>thd_iochan.[ch]</tt>, which are
compiled into <tt>libmri.a</tt>.
<p>An IOCHAN is opened with the function <tt>iochan_init</tt>,
which takes two arguments. The first argument is a string that
specifies what kind of channel is desired (TCP/IP or shared
memory), and also specifies other information about the channel.
The second argument is the string <tt>"w"</tt> for an IOCHAN that
is intended to be mostly written by the caller, or is the string
<tt>"r"</tt> for one that is intended to be mostly read by the
caller. An image source program should always use <tt>"w"</tt>,
since it is sending data to <i>AFNI</i>.</p>
<p>The format of an IOCHAN specification for a TCP/IP socket is:
<tt>"tcp:hostname:portnumber"</tt>, where <tt>hostname</tt> is the
computer name (or IP address in dot format) with which you wish to
communicate, and <tt>portnumber</tt> is the TCP/IP "port number"
that should be opened. For example, the realtime plugin control
port number is 7954, so that to open a socket IOCHAN to the
realtime plugin running on the current host, the call might be</p>
<pre>
  IOCHAN * ioc ;
  ioc = iochan_init( "tcp:localhost:7954" , "w" ) ;
  if( ioc == NULL ) fprintf(stderr,"** Failure to open control channel\n");
</pre>
In this example, the IOCHAN struct pointed to by <tt>ioc</tt> will
have a socket that is created using the Unix system call
<tt>connect</tt>, which will reach out to the specified host to
make the connection. If <tt>"r"</tt> were used for the second
argument, the program would use the Unix system call
<tt>accept</tt> to wait for another program to try to connect.
<p>The format of an IOCHAN specification for a shared memory
segment is: <tt>"shm:name:size"</tt>, where <tt>name</tt> is a
symbolic name to be attached to the memory segment (used to
distinguish it from other shared memory segments) and <tt>size</tt>
is the size of the memory segment in bytes. This size determines
the amount of data that can be transferred without blocking, and
should be at least twice the size of a single image that will be
transferred at one time. For example:</p>
<pre>
  IOCHAN * ioc ;
  ioc = iochan_init( "shm:Elvis:2M" , "w" ) ;
  if( ioc == NULL ) fprintf(stderr,"** Failure to open control channel\n");
</pre>
In this example, <tt>size = 2M</tt> means a 2 megabyte buffer is
used. If the "<tt>M</tt>" were left off, it would mean a 2 byte
buffer, which would be rather useless. (You can also use the suffix
"<tt>K</tt>" to indicate the buffer size in Kilobytes.)
<blockquote><b><tt>shm</tt> Note #1</b>: All operating systems that
I know of put a limit on the size of a shared memory segment. On
some systems, this limit is fairly small. You may have to increase
this limit in order to use <tt>shm:</tt> IOCHANs as large as the
one in the example above. In all cases, changing this limit can
only be done by the superuser, and depends on the Unix platform you
are using.
<ul>
<li>On Linux, the "shmmax" kernel parameter sets the size of the
largest shared memory segment. You can examine this value by the
command
<pre>
  cat /proc/sys/kernel/shmmax
</pre></li>
<li>On Solaris, the command
<pre>
  /usr/bin/sysdef | grep -i SHM
</pre>
will show the shared memory parameters. They can be altered by
editing the file <tt>/etc/system</tt> and rebooting, but I don't
know the details.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><tt>shm</tt> Note #2</b>: Another operating system dependent
issue is whether the function call that deletes a shared memory
segment destroys it immediately, or only marks it for destruction,
with the actual destruction only occurring when all other processes
detach from the segment. This makes a difference in <i>AFNI</i>,
since the normal way for a program to close a <tt>shm:</tt> IOCHAN
is to delete the shared memory segment. However, if this causes the
immediate destruction of the segment, then the other process
attached to the IOCHAN will print out some error messages,
complaining that the shared memory buffer has gone bad.</p>
<p>To avoid such messages, set the environment variable
<tt>IOCHAN_DELAY_RMID</tt> to the string <tt>YES</tt>. Then the
<tt>shm:</tt> IOCHAN memory buffer will only be deleted when the
last process detaches from it.</p>
<ul>
<li>You are probably wondering why the default action is to delete
the shared memory segment immediately. The reason is that shared
memory segments are perfectly capable of living on with no
processes attached to them. Thus, if the image source <b>and</b>
<i>AFNI</i> both crash, you'd be left with a chunk of your memory
being locked up. Therefore, my original policy was to delete the
shared memory segment as soon as it wasn't needed. However, this
can lead to annoying error messages. Thus, the introduction of
<tt>IOCHAN_DELAY_RMID</tt>. (BTW, <tt>RMID</tt> is the
<tt>shmctl()</tt> function code for removing a shared memory
segment.)</li>
</ul>
<p>For <i>AFNI</i>, you can set <tt>IOCHAN_DELAY_RMID</tt> in your
<tt>.afnirc</tt> file (cf. <a href=
"http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/src/README.environment">README.environment</a>).
However, this won't affect the image source program, so you should
probably set it explicitly in your <tt>.cshrc</tt> file (or
equivalent), if needed.</p>
<p>On most Unix systems, the <tt>ipcs -m</tt> command will show you
the shared memory segments that currently exist. If something is
left dangling (with 0 processes attached) from an <i>AFNI</i> run,
you might be able to delete it with the <tt>ipcrm</tt> command. But
be careful - you don't want to delete a shared memory segment from
some other program! (For example, KDE uses shared memory to
communicate.)</p>
<p>If you are writing your own image source program, you can look
at <tt>rtfeedme.c</tt> to see how to ensure that IOCHANs are closed
when the program exits, even if it exits because of a crash
condition (e.g., segfault). This goal is accomplished by creating a
signal handler to catch fatal errors; the signal handler function
then closes down any open IOCHANs before it actually exits. This
technique is a way to prevent dangling shared memory segments.
(Chicken soup might help, too.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A TCP/IP IOCHAN can be used bi-directionally, once both
processes have attached to it. This is not true of the shared
memory IOCHAN shown above: only the writing process can write to
it, and only the reading process can read from it. To avoid this
difficulty, a second form of shared memory IOCHAN can be created
with a specification of the form <tt>"shm:name:size1+size2"</tt>.
Here, <tt>size1</tt> is the size of the buffer that will be used by
the <tt>"w"</tt> process to write into and by the <tt>"r"</tt>
process to read from; <tt>size2</tt> is the size of the buffer that
will be used by the <tt>"r"</tt> process to write into and by the
<tt>"w"</tt> process to read from. These sizes can be different,
which might be useful if more data is expected to flow one way than
another.</p>
<ul>
<li>The IOCHANs used in the realtime plugin need only be
uni-directional. The image source program sends data to
<i>AFNI</i>, but <i>AFNI</i> never sends data back.</li>
</ul>
After an IOCHAN is created, it is not necessarily ready to be used.
Until the other process (<i>AFNI</i> in this case) attaches to the
IOCHAN, no data can be sent. A number of functions are available to
check if an IOCHAN is in a usable state. They are documented in the
comments at the head of <a href=
"http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/src/thd_iochan.c"><tt>thd_iochan.c</tt></a>, and examples of their
use can be found in <a href=
"http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/src/rtfeedme.c"><tt>rtfeedme.c</tt></a>.
<p><font color="#BB0000"><u><b>The Structure of
<tt>rtfeedme.c</tt></b></u></font><br />
This program initiates the conversation with <i>AFNI</i> with the
function <tt>AFNI_start_io</tt>, which will establish the control
IOCHAN, send the control information down it, close the control
IOCHAN, and then open the data IOCHAN. After that is accomplished,
the main program actually sends the image metadata and then finally
the images themselves.</p>
<p><tt>AFNI_start_io</tt> is designed to allow its caller to
perform other functions while it is establishing the communications
with <i>AFNI</i>. In <tt>rtfeedme.c</tt>, the caller
(<tt>main</tt>) doesn't do anything, but just calls
<tt>AFNI_start_io</tt> repeatedly until it signals that it is
ready. In the MCW actual realtime image source program,
<tt>AFNI_start_io</tt> is called once every time an echo-planar
image is acquired. When the data IOCHAN is finally opened, then the
stored images are sent, and after that every time a new image is
acquired, it is sent immediately. <tt>AFNI_start_io</tt> moves
through 5 modes, labeled by symbolic constants:</p>
<pre>
  #define AFNI_OPEN_CONTROL_MODE   1  /* 1st time thru: open control channel */
  #define AFNI_WAIT_CONTROL_MODE   2  /* waiting for AFNI to open control    */
  #define AFNI_OPEN_DATA_MODE      3  /* now can open data channel to AFNI   */
  #define AFNI_CATCHUP_MODE        4  /* waiting for AFNI to open data       */
  #define AFNI_CONTINUE_MODE       5  /* at last! data channel is ready!     */
</pre>
The mode that the routine is in at any moment is stored in the
global variable <tt>AFNI_mode</tt>, which should be set to
<tt>AFNI_OPEN_CONTROL_MODE</tt> before the first call to
<tt>AFNI_start_io</tt>. The sequence of events is outlined below
(you should also read <tt>rtfeedme.c</tt> to see how this works):
<ul>
<li>When the control IOCHAN is successfully opened, the mode
switches to <tt>AFNI_WAIT_CONTROL_MODE</tt>.</li>
<li>In this situation, <tt>AFNI_start_io</tt> simply checks if the
realtime plugin has connected to the control socket. If not,
<tt>AFNI_start_io</tt> returns without changing its mode. The
caller program can then do whatever it wants (in
<tt>rtfeedme.c</tt>, that is exactly nothing), repeatedly calling
<tt>AFNI_start_io</tt> to have it check up on the communication
status.</li>
<li>When the plugin connects, <tt>AFNI_start_io</tt> then sends the
necessary control information (more on this later), waits for it to
be received, then closes the control IOCHAN, opens the data IOCHAN,
and enters <tt>AFNI_OPEN_DATA_MODE</tt>.</li>
<li>It now waits for the the realtime plugin to open the data
IOCHAN itself. When this is done, the mode switches to
<tt>AFNI_CATCHUP_MODE</tt>.</li>
<li>In <tt>rtfeedme.c</tt>, nothing happens in this mode; in a real
image source program, this is where previously acquired images
could now be sent to <i>AFNI</i> (thus the name "catchup"). The
mode now switches to <tt>AFNI_CONTINUE_MODE</tt>, indicating that
the data IOCHAN is ready.</li>
</ul>
At this point, <tt>AFNI_start_io</tt> is finished, and the actual
transmission of image information is the responsibility of the
caller.
<p><font color="#BB0000"><u><b>Realtime Control
IOCHAN</b></u></font><br />
When not acquiring data, the realtime plugin is listening on socket
7954, so the image source program starts talking to <i>AFNI</i>
with the code (taken from <tt>rtfeedme.c</tt>):</p>
<pre>
 #define AFNI_CONTROL_PORT 7954
    char AFNI_iochan[128] , AFNI_host[128] ;
    IOCHAN * AFNI_ioc ;

    sprintf( AFNI_iochan , "tcp:%s:%d" , AFNI_host , AFNI_CONTROL_PORT ) ;
    AFNI_ioc = iochan_init( AFNI_iochan , "w" ) ;
</pre>
At this point, the image source must wait until the realtime plugin
connects to the newly opened socket, as described above.
<p>When the control IOCHAN is ready, the control information should
be sent. The control information is a single C NUL-terminated
string, which will contain 1 or 2 lines of data. The first line of
data is just the string that specifies the data IOCHAN (which can
be of <tt>shm:</tt> or <tt>tcp:</tt> type).</p>
<p>The second line of control data, if present, specifies a command
that realtime plugin should execute to obtain the image metadata.
If there is no second line of data (that is, there is no
<tt>'\n'</tt> character in the control string), then all the image
metadata must come from the image source program itself. Otherwise,
the realtime plugin will execute the metadata command in a child
process; it will capture the standard output of this command and
use that as (most of) the image metadata.</p>
<p>The reason for this provision is that some aspects of the images
may not be known when the image source program starts. For example,
at the <b>old MCW 3 Tesla Bruker system</b>, the image acquisition program does not
know the orientation or dimensions of the data. This information
must be obtained by querying the MRI console software after the
acquisition actually starts. The program <a href=
"http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/src/3T_toafni.c"><tt>3T_toafni.c</tt></a> is the medium by which
this query is made. The response from the MRI console is parsed and
converted to <i>AFNI</i> image metadata, and written to
<tt>stdout</tt>. Thus, in the MCW realtime acquisition system, the
control information looks something like this:</p>
<pre>
  "shm:Elvis:1M\n3T_toafni"
</pre>
Since <tt>rtfeedme.c</tt> will supply all the image metadata itself
through the data IOCHAN, no metadata command is used in this sample
program.
<p><font color="#BB0000"><u><b>Data IOCHAN</b></u></font><br />
When the data IOCHAN is ready, then the image source program must
send <i>some</i> image metadata as the first transmission. (The
details of the image metadata are discussed in the next section.)
If an external metadata command is used to supply this information,
then only one metadata command need be supplied. In the MCW 3 Tesla
realtime system, this command is generated by</p>
<pre>
  char mdata[128] ;
  sprintf( mdata , "DATUM short\nXYMATRIX %d %d\n" , nx,ny ) ;
</pre>
where <tt>nx</tt> and <tt>ny</tt> define the array dimensions of
the reconstructed slices. (This information is not available from
the MRI console, since the reconstruction matrix need not be the
same as the <i>k</i>-space acquisition matrix.) After the
NUL-terminated metadata command string, all further data that comes
down the data IOCHAN is taken to be raw image slice (or volume)
data.
<hr noshade="noshade" />
<h2>Image Metadata Commands</h2>
<i>AFNI</i> needs some information about the acquisition in order
to properly construct a dataset from the images. This information
is sent to <i>AFNI</i> as a series of command strings. A sample set
of command strings is given below:
[Also see the file
<a href="http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/src/README.realtime">README.realtime</a>
for full details on the Realtime plugin's metadata (AKA prolog or header).]
<pre>
<b> ACQUISITION_TYPE 2D+zt
   TR 5.0
   XYFOV 240.0 240.0 112.0
   ZNUM 16
   XYZAXES S-I A-P L-R
   DATUM short
   XYMATRIX 64 64
</b>
</pre>

The commands can be given in any order. Each command takes up a
single line of input (i.e., commands are separated by the '\n'
character in the input buffer, and the whole set of commands is
terminated by the usual '\0'). The entire set of commands must be
less than 32 Kbytes long (the usual length is about 200
characters). Each command line has one or more arguments. The full
list of possible command strings and their arguments is given
below.
<ul>
<li><b><tt>ACQUISITION_TYPE arg</tt></b><br />
This command tells <i>AFNI</i> how the image data will be
formatted:
<pre>
    arg = 2D+z   -&gt; a single 3D volume, one slice at a time
          2D+zt  -&gt; multiple 3D volumes, one slice at a time [the default]
          3D     -&gt; a single 3D volume, all at once
          3D+t   -&gt; multiple 3D volumes, one full volume at a time
</pre>
<b>--</b> This command is not required, since there is a
default.</li>
<li><b><tt>NAME arg</tt></b><br />
This command tells <i>AFNI</i> what name to use for the new
dataset.<br />
<b>--</b> It is not required, since <i>AFNI</i> will generate a
name if none is given (but you may not like that name).</li>
<li><b><tt>TR arg</tt></b><br />
This command tells <i>AFNI</i> what the imaging TR is, in seconds.
The default value, if this command is not given, is 1.0.<br />
<b>--</b> It is recommended that this command be used for
multi-brick datasets, so that the header information is correct.
But this command is not required.</li>
<li><b><tt>ZDELTA dz</tt></b><br />
This command tells <i>AFNI</i> the slice thickness, in mm.<br />
<b>--</b> This command, or <b><tt>XYFOV</tt></b> with 'zz'&gt;0,
MUST be used, so that the correct size of the dataset along the
z-axis size known.</li>
<li><b><tt>XYFOV xx yy [zz]</tt></b><br />
This command tells <i>AFNI</i> the size of the images, in mm. The
first value ('xx') is the x-axis dimension, and the second value
('yy') is the y-axis dimension. If the third value ('zz') is
present, then it is the z-axis dimension (slab thickness of all
slices).<br />
<b>--</b> This command MUST be used to at least to give the sizes
of the dataset along the x- and y-axes. If 'zz' is not given, then
the <b><tt>ZDELTA</tt></b> command is also required.<br />
<b>--</b> If 'yy'==0, then it is taken to be the same as 'xx'
(square images).</li>
<li><b><tt>ZGAP gg</tt></b><br />
This command tells <i>AFNI</i> to add 'gg' mm to the slice
thickness computed from the 'zz' parameter of
<b><tt>XYFOV</tt></b>. If 'zz' was given in <b><tt>XYFOV</tt></b>,
then the slice thickness is computed 'zz/znum+gg', where 'znum' is
from <b><tt>XYMATRIX</tt></b> or <b><tt>ZNUM</tt></b>.
<ul>
<li>If the slice thickness is given explicitly via
<b><tt>ZDELTA</tt></b>, then the value of 'gg' has no effect.</li>
<li>This option added 18 Dec 2002, per the request of Larry Frank
of UCSD.</li>
</ul>
<b>--</b> This command is optional; the default 'gg' is zero.</li>
<li><b><tt>ZFIRST zz[d]</tt></b><br />
Specifies the location of the first slice, along the z-axis, in mm.
The value 'zz' gives the offset. The optional code 'd' gives the
direction that distance 'zz' applies; if present, the 'd' character
must immediately follow the 'zz' value, as in '50I'. The values
allowed for the single character 'd' are
<pre>
    I = inferior
    S = superior
    A = anterior
    P = posterior
    R = right
    L = left
</pre>
<b>--</b> This command is optional - if not given, then the volume
will be centered about z=0 (which is also the default for the x-
and y-axes). If the direction code 'd' is given, then it must agree
with the sense of the z-axis given in the <b><tt>XYZAXES</tt></b>
command (e.g., if z-axis is I-S, the 'd' must be 'I' or 'S'). When
more than one dataset is being acquired in a scanning session, then
getting <b><tt>ZFIRST</tt></b> correct is important so that the
<i>AFNI</i> datasets will be properly positioned relative to each
other (e.g., so you can overlay SPGR and EPI data correctly).</li>
<li><b><tt>XYZFIRST xx[d] yy[d] zz[d]</tt></b><br />
This new option [11 Dec 2002] lets you set the offsets of the
dataset volume on all 3 axes. It is very similar to
<b><tt>ZFIRST</tt></b> above, but you give values for all axes. For
example:
<pre>
<b> XYZAXES  S-I A-P L-R
   XYZFIRST 30 20A 50R
</b>
</pre>
sets
<ul>
<li>the x-origin to 30S (since no direction code was given for
x),</li>
<li>the y-origin to 20A, and</li>
<li>the z-origin to 50R.</li>
<li>Since the z-axis is L-R and starts in the R hemisphere, these
sagittal slices are all in the R hemisphere.</li>
<li>If the 'R' code had been left off the '50R', then the z-origin
would have been set to 50L. Note that the origin is the CENTER of
the first voxel.</li>
</ul>
<b>--</b> This command is optional. If it is given along with
<b><tt>ZFIRST</tt></b> (why?), then whichever one comes last wins
(for the z-axis).</li>
<li><b><tt>XYZOFF xoff yoff zoff</tt></b><br />
This option is a different way of specifying the offsets of the
dataset volume on all 3 axes. The default (if neither
<b><tt>XYZFIRST</tt></b> nor <b><tt>XYZOFF</tt></b> is given) is to
center the volume about the (x,y,z)=(0,0,0) point.
<ul>
<li><u>Centering example</u>: If the x-axis is 240 mm and 64 pixels
across, the default value of the center of the first voxel is
x=0.5*(64-1)*(240/64)=118.125. The direction of this offset is the
same as the first initial of 'xcode' from <b><tt>XYZAXES</tt></b>
(e.g., if 'xcode' is 'I-S', this offset is in the 'I'
direction).</li>
<li>In the case of <b><tt>XYZFIRST</tt></b>, the effect is to
specify the center (x,y,z) of the first voxel explicitly.</li>
<li>In the case of <b><tt>XYZOFF</tt></b>, the effect is to
<i>shift</i> the center of the first voxel from the default
location by the amounts (xoff,yoff,zoff); in the example above,
'xoff' would be added to 118.125 to determine the x-center of the
first voxel.</li>
<li>This option added 18 Dec 2002, per the request of Larry Frank
of UCSD.</li>
</ul>
<b>--</b> This command is optional.</li>
<li><b><tt>XYMATRIX nx ny [nz]</tt></b><br />
Specifies the size of the images to come, in pixels:
<pre>
    nx = number of pixels along x-axis
    ny = number of pixels along y-axis
    nz = number of pixels along z-axis (optional here)
</pre>
<b>--</b> This command is required. If 'nz' is not given here, then
it must be given using the <b><tt>ZNUM</tt></b> command.</li>
<li><b><tt>ZNUM nz</tt></b><br />
Specifies the number of pixels along the z-axis (slice
direction).<br />
<b>--</b> This value must be given, either with
<b><tt>XYMATRIX</tt></b> or <b><tt>ZNUM</tt></b>.<br /></li>
<li><b><tt>DATUM typ</tt></b><br />
Specifies the type of data in the images:
<pre>
    typ = short   -&gt; 16 bit signed integers [the default]
          float   -&gt; 32 bit IEEE floats
          byte    -&gt; 8 bit unsigned integers
          complex -&gt; 64 bit IEEE complex values (real/imag pairs)
</pre>
<b>--</b> This command is not required, as long as the data are
really shorts. The amount of data read for each image will be
determined by this command, the <b><tt>XYMATRIX</tt></b>
dimensions, and the <b><tt>ACQUISITION_TYPE</tt></b> (whether 2D or
3D data is being sent).</li>
<li><b><tt>ZORDER arg</tt></b><br />
Specifies the order in which the slices will be read.
<pre>
    arg = alt -&gt; alternating order (e.g., slices are presented
                   to AFNI in order 1 3 5 7 9 2 4 6 8, when nz=9).
        = seq -&gt; sequential order (e.g., slices are presented
                   to AFNI in order 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9, when nz=9).
</pre>
<b>--</b> This command is not required, since 'alt' is the default.
It will be ignored if a 3D <b><tt>ACQUISITION_TYPE</tt></b> is
used.</li>
<li><b><tt>XYZAXES xcode ycode zcode</tt></b><br />
Specifies the orientation of the 3D volume data being sent to
<i>AFNI</i>. Each of the 3 codes specifies one axis orientation,
along which the corresponding pixel coordinate increases. The
possible codes are:
<pre>
    I-S (or IS) -&gt; inferior-to-superior
    S-I (or SI) -&gt; superior-to-inferior
    A-P (or AP) -&gt; anterior-to-posterior
    P-A (or PA) -&gt; posterior-to-anterior
    R-L (or RL) -&gt; right-to-left
    L-R (or LR) -&gt; left-to-right
</pre>
For example, "<b><tt>XYZAXES S-I A-P L-R</tt></b>" specifies a
sagittal set of slices, with the slice acquisition order being
left-to-right. (In this example, if <b><tt>ZFIRST</tt></b> is used,
the 'd' code in that command must be either 'L' or 'R'.) The 3
different axes codes must point in different spatial directions
(e.g., you can't say "<b><tt>XYZAXES S-I A-P I-S</tt></b>").<br />
<b>--</b> This command is required, so that <i>AFNI</i> knows the
orientation of the slices in space.</li>
<li><b><tt>NUM_CHAN nc</tt></b><br />
Specifies the number of independent image "channels" that will be
sent to <i>AFNI</i>. Each channel goes into a separate dataset.
Channel images are interleaved; for example, if nc=3, then
<pre>
    image #1 -&gt; datataset #1
    image #2 -&gt; datataset #2
    image #3 -&gt; datataset #3
    image #4 -&gt; datataset #1
    image #5 -&gt; datataset #2
<i>et cetera</i>
</pre>
<ul>
<li>For 2D acquisitions, each slice is one "image" in the list
above.</li>
<li>For 3D acquisitions, each volume is one "image".</li>
</ul>
All channels must have the same datum type, the same xyz
dimensions, and so on.<br />
<b>--</b> This command is optional, since the default value of nc
is 1.</li>
<li><b><tt>DRIVE_AFNI command</tt></b><br />
You can also pass commands to control <i>AFNI</i> (e.g., open
windows) in the image prolog. See <a href=
"http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/src/README.driver">README.driver</a> for the list of
command strings. More than one <b><tt>DRIVE_AFNI</tt></b> command
can be used in the realtime prolog. Each command is executed in
sequence. For example, if you wish to put new datasets into a new
directory called "aaa", you could pass the commands
<pre>
<b> DRIVE_AFNI SYSTEM mkdir aaa
   DRIVE_AFNI CHDIR aaa
</b>
</pre>
<b>--</b> This command is optional.</li>
<li><b><tt>NOTE text to attach to dataset</tt></b><br />
This command lets you attach text notes to the dataset(s) being
created by the realtime plugin. All the text after
"<b><tt>NOTE</tt></b> ", up to (not including) the next '\n', will
be attached as a text note. More than one <b><tt>NOTE</tt></b> can
be given. If you want to send a multiline note, then you have to
convert the '\n' characters in the note text to '\a' or '\f'
characters (ASCII 7 and 12 (decimal), respectively). Any '\a' or
'\f' characters in the text will be converted to '\n' characters
before the note is processed.<br />
<b>--</b> This command is optional.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Recording Results of <i>rtfeedme</i>+<i>AFNI</i> - April
2002</h2>
<i>AFNI</i> now has the ability to record the sequence of images as
they are computed and displayed by the realtime plugin.  (This option is
distinct from saving the acquired images themselves; I'm referring to
saving the images displayed in an AFNI viewer window.)
The following sequence of operations would be needed:
<ol>
<li>You need a 3D+time <i>AFNI</i> dataset to simulate sending
realtime data to the program.</li>
<li>Open 2 terminal windows, and cd to that directory in both of
them.</li>
<li>Start <i>AFNI</i> with realtime I/O enabled in one of the
terminals with the command "<tt>afni -rt</tt>".</li>
<li>Now you have to set for realtime analysis and display. To start
with, open the Axial Image and Graph windows. In the Graph window,
use the FIM menu (lower right corner) to "Pick Ideal", and select
some 1D file as the ideal. This should then graph on top of the
central sub-graph.
<ul>
<li>Next, in the main <i>AFNI</i> control window, click on "Define
Datamode", then on the "Plugins" menu (lower right corner), and
then on "RT Options". This opens the window that controls the
realtime acquisition options. You want to set "Function" to "FIM",
then press "Run+Close" to have that information saved in
<i>AFNI</i>.</li>
<li>The function type must be set to "FIM" and the 1D ideal chosen
before the images start to arrive from <i>rtfeedme</i>. Otherwise
the correlational function analysis will not be performed.</li>
<li>Next, you want to turn on image recording in the Image window.
To do this, expand the size of the Image window until you can
clearly see all the buttons at the bottom. To the right of the
"Done" button is "Rec". From that menu, choose "Stay On". This
means that each new image that is displayed will be recorded into a
special image viewer. These can then be saved later.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You are now ready to send the data into <i>AFNI</i> for
realtime analysis. The command to send the dataset to <i>AFNI</i>
via the realtime socket is
<pre>
<b>rtfeedme -dt 300 dataset+orig</b>
</pre>
This will feed the dataset, 300 ms per slice, to <i>AFNI</i>. Since
you selected FIM on the RT Options plugin, you will get a sequence
of colored overlays displayed in the Image window. Since Record is
turned on, you will also get a new image window popping up that
will contain the recorded images. Wait until the data is all sent
to <i>AFNI</i>.</li>
<li>You can now save the recorded images to disk. To choose the
format, right click on the "Save:bkg" button in the Record window
(not the original Image window). You should see at least
"Save.ppm". Choose that and press "Set" - then the button should
now say "Save.ppm". Press this button with the left mouse click
now. You get 3 dialog boxes in order, that ask for "Filename
prefix", "Slice from", and "Slice to". This will let you save the
images to external files named fred.0000.ppm, et cetera.
<ul>
<li>If program <i>mpeg_encode</i> is in your path, then you can
also write a sequence of images to an MPEG-1 movie file. You can
compile <i>mpeg_encode</i> from the <i>AFNI</i> source distribution
with the command "<tt>make mpeg_encode</tt>".</li>
<li>Similarly, if the program <i>gifsicle</i> is in your path, then
you can also write a sequence of images to an animated GIF file.
You can compile <i>gifsicle</i> from the <i>AFNI</i> source
distribution with the command "<tt>make gifsicle</tt>".</li>
<li>If the <i>netpbm</i> package of programs is compiled on your
system and in your path, then <i>AFNI</i> can also use these to
convert individual images in the viewer to TIFF, GIF, etc., files.
However, <i>netpbm</i> is not included with <i>AFNI</i>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
A much simpler way would be to use a video camera or some software tool
to record the screen as you run the acquisition.
