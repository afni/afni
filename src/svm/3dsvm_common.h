"+++++++++++++++ 3dsvm: support vector machine analysis of brain data  +++++++++++++++\n\n"

"This plugin provides the ability to perform support vector machine \n"
"(SVM) analyses (training and testing) using SVM-Light (version 5),\n"
"developed by Thorsten Joachims, (http://svmlight.joachims.org/).\n"
"\n"
"General notes:\n"
"--------------\n"
" - This GUI plugin has a corresponding command-line version, 3dsvm \n"
"which offers extra functionality for learning and classification \n"
"with SVM-Light.  For example, the full set of SVM-Light command \n"
"line options is available in 3dsvm. \n"
"\n"
"Using the Plugin:\n"
"-----------------\n"
" - The user can choose to perform SVM training and testing either \n"
"alone or together.  This is done by selecting the \"Training\" and \n"
"or \"Testing\" options accordingly.  The interface is organized by \n"
"option lines: \n"
"\n"
"  1)  Training - Select this option to perform SVM training. \n"
"\n"
"  2)  Train Data - Perform SVM learning using the data specified on \n"
"      this line. \n"
"\n"
"    a.  Dataset - Choose a 3D+t training dataset from the current session.\n"
"\n"
"    b.  Labels - Choose a .1D file indicating the class label for each \n"
"    time point in the dataset. The number of entries in the selected file \n"
"    must be equal to the number of time points in the chosen training \n"
"    dataset.  The labels must be arranged in a single column, and they \n"
"    can take on any of the following values: \n"
"\n"
"       0    - class 0\n"
"       1    - class 1\n"
"       n    - class n\n"
"       9999 - censor this point\n"
"\n"
"       It is recommended to use a continuous set of class labels, starting\n"
"       at 0. See next section on censors.\n"
"\n"
"    c.  Censors - Choosing a .1D file for this option allows \n"
"    the user to ignore certain samples in the training data. \n"
"    To ignore a specific sample, put a 0 in the row corresponding \n"
"    to the time sample - i.e., to ignore sample t, place a 0 in row t \n"
"    of the file.  All samples that are to be included in training \n"
"    must have a 1 in the corresponding row.  If no censor file is \n"
"    specified, all samples will be used for training. \n"
"\n"

"  3)  Train Params - parameters to control training. \n"
"\n"
"    a.  Mask - Allows the user to choose a mask (ROI) to apply to \n"
"    the training data.  For example, a mask of the whole brain can \n"
"    be generated by using 3dAutomask, or more specific ROIs could be \n"
"    generated with the Draw Dataset plugin or converted from a thresholded \n"
"    functional dataset. The mask dataset must be a byte-format brik \n"
"    file and must be in the current session to appear in the chooser. \n"
"    The mask is specified during training but is also considered part of\n"
"    the model output and is automatically applied to test data. A mask\n"
"    is currently required by the plugin.\n"
"\n"
"    b.  Kernel - The kernel type that is used for learning. Currently\n"
"    the user only has the choice of \"Linear\". \n"
"\n"
"    c.  C - an SVM parameter that represents the trade off between \n"
"    the training error and the margin.  Default value is 100. \n"
"\n"

"  4)  Model Output \n"
"\n"
"    a.  Prefix - enter a prefix for the basename of the output model brik \n"
"    and any auxillary files generated during training. \n"
"\n"
"  5)  Model Inspection - The entries in this option line allow the \n"
"  user to specify output files that can be used to examine the SVM\n"
"  training model. \n"
"\n"
"    a.  FIM prefix - The user can choose to write out the sum of weighted \n"
"    linear support vectors to a functional (fim) brik file. This is \n"
"    one means of generating an \"activation map\" from linear kernel \n"
"    SVMs (see LaConte et al, 2005).\n" 
"\n"
"    b.  Alpha Prefix (.1D) - save the alpha file generated by SVM-Light.\n"
"\n"
"  6)  Testing - Classify a set of volumes using a training model.\n"
"  If both training and testing options are specified to be run by\n"
"  the plugin, the model produced by training is applied directly to\n"
"  the test data.  If testing is done alone, the SVM model file must\n"
"  be specified.\n" 
"\n"

"  7)  Test Data - Perform SVM testing using the data specified on \n"
"  this line.\n"
"\n"
"    a.  Dataset - The 3D or 3D+t dataset to test. A major assumption\n"
"    is that the training and testing volumes are aligned, and that\n"
"    voxels are of same number, volume, etc.\n"
"\n"
"    b.  Model - The AFNI BRIK/HEAD file is generated by SVM training. \n"
"    Currently, if training and testing are done at once then a model\n"
"    should not be selected here.\n"
"\n"
"  8)  Label Output - Ouput a .1D file containing a single \n"
"  column holding the values of the predictions resulting from the \n"
"  application of the training model to the test data.  One value \n"
"  is present for each tested volume. These values take on a continuous \n"
"  range; negative values correspond to class 0, positive values to \n"
"  class 1. \n"
"\n"
"    a.  Prefix (.1D) - The prefix to use for the naming of the output \n"
"    file. \n"
"\n"

"  9)  'True' Labels - A .1D label file that contains the true class values \n"
"  of the samples in the test dataset.  It is used to calculate the \n"
"  performance (successes, failures) of SVM classification.  If this option \n"
"  is not chosen, then performance calculations (like prediction accuracy)\n"
"   are not made. \n"
"\n"
"    a.  File - Choose the file to use for testing accuracy calculations. \n"
"\n"

"Summary:\n"
"-----------------\n"
" Train \n"
"      Required: Train Data (Dataset, Labels); Train Params (Mask); \n"
"                Model Output (Prefix).\n"
"      Optional: Train Data (Censors); Train Params (Kernel, C); \n"
"                Model Inspection (FIM Prefix, Alpha Prefix (.1D)). \n"
" Test \n"
