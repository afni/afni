   "With virtuous wish would bear your living flowers,\n"
   "Much liker than your painted counterfeit:\n"

   "  But were some child of yours alive that time,\n"
   "  You should live twice; in it and in my rhyme.\n"

   "And for a woman wert thou first created;\n"
   "Till Nature, as she wrought thee, fell a-doting,\n"

   "Thy beauty's form in table of my heart;\n"
   "My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,\n"

   "For through the painter must you see his skill,\n"
   "To find where your true image pictured lies;\n"

   "May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it,\n"
   "But that I hope some good conceit of thine\n"
   "In thy soul's thought, all naked, will bestow it;\n"
   "Till whatsoever star that guides my moving\n"
   "Points on me graciously with fair aspect\n"
   "And puts apparel on my tatter'd loving,\n"
   "To show me worthy of thy sweet respect:\n"

,
   "Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,\n"
   "The dear repose for limbs with travel tired;\n"

,
   "When, in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes,\n"

   "When to the sessions of sweet silent thought\n"
   "I summon up remembrance of things past,\n"
   "I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,\n"
   "And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:\n"
   "Then can I drown an eye, unused to flow,\n"
   "For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,\n"
   "And weep afresh love's long since cancell'd woe,\n"
   "And moan the expense of many a vanish'd sight:\n"
   "Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,\n"
   "And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er\n"
   "The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,\n"

   "One blushing shame, another white despair;\n"
   "A third, nor red nor white, had stol'n of both\n"
   "And to his robbery had annex'd thy breath;\n"
   "But, for his theft, in pride of all his growth\n"
   "A vengeful canker eat him up to death.\n"
   "  More flowers I noted, yet I none could see\n"
   "  But sweet or colour it had stol'n from thee.\n"
,
   "Where art thou, Muse, that thou forget'st so long\n"
   "To speak of that which gives thee all thy might?\n"
   "Spend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song,\n"
   "Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light?\n"
   "Return, forgetful Muse, and straight redeem\n"
   "In gentle numbers time so idly spent;\n"
   "Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem\n"
   "And gives thy pen both skill and argument.\n"
   "Rise, resty Muse, my love's sweet face survey,\n"
   "If Time have any wrinkle graven there;\n"
   "If any, be a satire to decay,\n"
   "And make Time's spoils despised every where.\n"
   "  Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life;\n"
   "  So thou prevent'st his scythe and crooked knife.\n"
,
   "O truant Muse, what shall be thy amends\n"
   "For thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed?\n"
   "Both truth and beauty on my love depends;\n"
   "So dost thou too, and therein dignified.\n"
   "Make answer, Muse: wilt thou not haply say\n"
   "'Truth needs no colour, with his colour fix'd;\n"
   "Beauty no pencil, beauty's truth to lay;\n"
   "But best is best, if never intermix'd?'\n"
   "Because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?\n"
   "Excuse not silence so; for't lies in thee\n"
   "To make him much outlive a gilded tomb,\n"
   "And to be praised of ages yet to be.\n"
   "  Then do thy office, Muse; I teach thee how\n"
   "  To make him seem long hence as he shows now.\n"
,
   "My love is strengthen'd, though more weak in seeming;\n"
   "I love not less, though less the show appear:\n"
   "That love is merchandized whose rich esteeming\n"
   "The owner's tongue doth publish every where.\n"
   "Our love was new and then but in the spring\n"
   "When I was wont to greet it with my lays,\n"
   "As Philomel in summer's front doth sing\n"
   "And stops her pipe in growth of riper days:\n"
   "Not that the summer is less pleasant now\n"
   "Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night,\n"
   "But that wild music burthens every bough\n"
   "And sweets grown common lose their dear delight.\n"
   "  Therefore like her I sometime hold my tongue,\n"
   "  Because I would not dull you with my song.\n"
,
   "Alack, what poverty my Muse brings forth,\n"
   "That having such a scope to show her pride,\n"
   "The argument all bare is of more worth\n"
   "Than when it hath my added praise beside!\n"
   "O, blame me not, if I no more can write!\n"
   "Look in your glass, and there appears a face\n"
   "That over-goes my blunt invention quite,\n"
   "Dulling my lines and doing me disgrace.\n"
   "Were it not sinful then, striving to mend,\n"
   "To mar the subject that before was well?\n"
   "For to no other pass my verses tend\n"
   "Than of your graces and your gifts to tell;\n"
   "  And more, much more, than in my verse can sit\n"
   "  Your own glass shows you when you look in it.\n"
,
   "To me, fair friend, you never can be old,\n"
   "For as you were when first your eye I eyed,\n"
   "Such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold\n"
   "Have from the forests shook three summers' pride,\n"
   "Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn'd\n"
   "In process of the seasons have I seen,\n"
   "Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burn'd,\n"
   "Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green.\n"
   "Ah! yet doth beauty, like a dial-hand,\n"
   "Steal from his figure and no pace perceived;\n"
   "So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand,\n"
   "Hath motion and mine eye may be deceived:\n"
   "  For fear of which, hear this, thou age unbred;\n"
   "  Ere you were born was beauty's summer dead.\n"
,

   "To one, of one, still such, and ever so.\n"
   "Kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,\n"
   "Still constant in a wondrous excellence;\n"
   "Therefore my verse to constancy confined,\n"
   "One thing expressing, leaves out difference.\n"
   "'Fair, kind and true' is all my argument,\n"
   "'Fair, kind, and true' varying to other words;\n"
   "And in this change is my invention spent,\n"
   "Three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords.\n"
   "  'Fair, kind, and true,' have often lived alone,\n"
   "  Which three till now never kept seat in one.\n"
,
   "When in the chronicle of wasted time\n"
   "I see descriptions of the fairest wights,\n"
   "And beauty making beautiful old rhyme\n"
   "In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights,\n"
   "Then, in the blazon of sweet beauty's best,\n"
   "Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,\n"
   "I see their antique pen would have express'd\n"
   "Even such a beauty as you master now.\n"
   "So all their praises are but prophecies\n"
   "Of this our time, all you prefiguring;\n"
   "And, for they look'd but with divining eyes,\n"
   "They had not skill enough your worth to sing:\n"
   "  For we, which now behold these present days,\n"
   "  Had eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.\n"
,
   "Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul\n"
   "Of the wide world dreaming on things to come,\n"
   "Can yet the lease of my true love control,\n"
   "Supposed as forfeit to a confined doom.\n"
   "The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured\n"
   "And the sad augurs mock their own presage;\n"
   "Incertainties now crown themselves assured\n"
   "And peace proclaims olives of endless age.\n"
   "Now with the drops of this most balmy time\n"
   "My love looks fresh, and death to me subscribes,\n"
   "Since, spite of him, I'll live in this poor rhyme,\n"
   "While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes:\n"
   "  And thou in this shalt find thy monument,\n"
   "  When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent.\n"
,
   "What's in the brain that ink may character\n"
   "Which hath not figured to thee my true spirit?\n"
   "What's new to speak, what new to register,\n"
   "That may express my love or thy dear merit?\n"
   "Nothing, sweet boy; but yet, like prayers divine,\n"
   "I must, each day say o'er the very same,\n"
   "Counting no old thing old, thou mine, I thine,\n"
   "Even as when first I hallow'd thy fair name.\n"
   "So that eternal love in love's fresh case\n"
   "Weighs not the dust and injury of age,\n"
   "Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,\n"
   "But makes antiquity for aye his page,\n"
   "  Finding the first conceit of love there bred\n"
   "  Where time and outward form would show it dead.\n"
,
   "O, never say that I was false of heart,\n"
   "Though absence seem'd my flame to qualify.\n"
   "As easy might I from myself depart\n"
   "As from my soul, which in thy breast doth lie:\n"
   "That is my home of love: if I have ranged,\n"
   "Like him that travels I return again,\n"
   "Just to the time, not with the time exchanged,\n"
   "So that myself bring water for my stain.\n"
   "Never believe, though in my nature reign'd\n"
   "All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,\n"
   "That it could so preposterously be stain'd,\n"
   "To leave for nothing all thy sum of good;\n"
   "  For nothing this wide universe I call,\n"
   "  Save thou, my rose; in it thou art my all.\n"
,
   "Alas, 'tis true I have gone here and there\n"
   "And made myself a motley to the view,\n"
   "Gored mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,\n"
   "Made old offences of affections new;\n"
   "Most true it is that I have look'd on truth\n"
   "Askance and strangely: but, by all above,\n"
   "These blenches gave my heart another youth,\n"
   "And worse essays proved thee my best of love.\n"
   "Now all is done, have what shall have no end:\n"
   "Mine appetite I never more will grind\n"
   "On newer proof, to try an older friend,\n"
   "A god in love, to whom I am confined.\n"

   "The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,\n"
