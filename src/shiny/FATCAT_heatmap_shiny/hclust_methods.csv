method,descriptionnone,No clustering.complete,Method of complete linkage or farthest neighbour. Proximity between two clusters is the proximity between their two most distant objects.single,Method of single linkage or nearest neighbour. Proximity between two clusters is the proximity between their two closest objects. average,"Method of between-group average linkage (UPGMA). Proximity between two clusters is the arithmetic mean of all the proximities between the objects of one, on one side, and the objects of the other, on the other side."median,"Median, or equilibrious centroid method (WPGMC) is the modified previous. Proximity between two clusters is the proximity between their geometric centroids (squared euclidean distance between those); while the centroids are defined so that the subclusters of which each of these two clusters were merged recently have equalized influence on its centroid – even if the subclusters differed in the number of objects."centroid,Centroid method (UPGMC).

Proximity between two clusters is the arithmetic mean of all the proximities between the objects of one, on one side, and the objects of the other, on the other side; while the subclusters of which each of these two clusters were merged recently have equalized influence on that proximity – even if the subclusters differed in the number of objects."
