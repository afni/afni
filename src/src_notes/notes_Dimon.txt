general outline of Dimon main()
   init_options()
      - init main structs: gD, GS, GAC, g_dicom_ctrl, A
      - populate p->opts struct from options
      - perform a few checks and var inits
   init_extras()
      - set 'nice' level and possibly init afni communication
   find_first_volume()
      - scan scan p->fim_o for a complete volume
      - while not done
         - read_image_files()    : read actual Dicom files (in state TO_READ)
            - get_sorted_file_names()
               - apply alphabetical or other file name sorting
            - read_new_images()
               - populate p->fim_o list with newly read images
                  - read those in state IFM_FSTATE_TO_READ
                  - set state to TO_PROC
            - make_sorted_fim_list()
               - n2sort = p->nfim - p->fim_start;

               - fp = p->fim_o + p->fim_start
               - sort p->fim_o in the new range (from fim_start to nfim)
                  - apply main sort, such as DEFAULT, GEME, NUM_SUFF
               - possibly post-order as zt
               - update fim_start to point to next TO_PROC image
                 (in case there are TO_SKIP images)
                  - p->fim_start += index
         - n2proc = nfim2proc() = num images in TO_PROC state
         - volume_search()
         - if no vol: think about life and paramaters, nap, try again
         - have vol, so...
            - update params (now that we know what to look for)
            - send vol to afni -rt
            - set sent image states to FSTATE_DONE
   find_more_volumes()
      - set to handle many signals by hf_signal()
      - set_volume_stats()
      - while not done
         - while there are read volumes that match v0
            - set_volume_stats()
            - send vol to afni -rt
            - update sent image states to FSTATE_DONE
         - read_image_files() : read any files in state TO_READ
         - n2proc = nfim2proc() = num images in TO_PROC state
         - if no volume of images to proc
            - quit, whine or read_image_files()



states:
   IFM_FSTATE_TO_READ      - ready to read image
                           - set at start of read_image_files()
   IFM_FSTATE_TO_PROC      - ready to start processing (from filename)
   IFM_FSTATE_TO_SORT      - ready to sort (window sorting)
                           - currently specific to GEME sorting
                           - it is within range of images to sort
   IFM_FSTATE_DONE         - finished sending volume
