\vspace{6ex}

\noindent
A {\bf bucket} dataset is a 3D dataset that can contain an
arbitrary number of sub-bricks.  These sub-bricks are not
considered to be time-ordered; rather, the bucket dataset type
is a place where the user can toss 3D bricks of data.

This documentation is provided to update the \afnit plugins
manual and to explain the programmatic interface for creating
bucket datasets.  It is current as of \afnit 2.20, and
is at present a work-in-progress ({\it i.e.},~subject to change
at a moment's whim).

Note that the entire \mcwafni package---including plugins---must be recompiled
to use these features.  This is because the internal
storage scheme used for datasets has been modified slightly.

\tableofcontents
\newpage
%---------------------------------------------------------------------
It has always been possible to create a 3D (no time) dataset with
multiple sub-bricks.  Until now, there has not been any program
that would do this, nor would any but the first sub-brick be
visible from within \afni.
The new program {\tt 3dbucket} allows the creation of
datasets with an arbitrary number of sub-bricks drawn from
the bricks of existing dataset.  \afnit has been modified
to allow the user to switch viewing between sub-bricks.
The dataset structure has been extended to allow extra
information to be attached to each sub-brick to make
them easy to distinguish.  A~programming interface has
been implemented that allows external programs (and plugins)
to create 3D bucket datasets.

%---------------------------------------------------------------------
\mysec{Sub-brick Auxiliary Data}
Three new types of data can be associated with each sub-brick in any
\afnit dataset (bucket, 3D+time,~\ldots). They are
\begin{description}

  \item[Label] This is a character string that is displayed on
               the \afnit bucket chooser menu that lets the user
               decide which sub-brick should be displayed (see~\S5).

  \item[Keywords] This is a character string that contains a
                  list of keywords that are to be associated
                  with a given sub-brick.  Each keyword is
                  separated by the C substring \hbox{\tt " ; "}.
                  At present, the keywords have no function
                  within any \mcwafni program, but that
                  is likely to change shortly.

  \item[Statistical Parameters]
         Each sub-brick can have a statistical type attached,
         exactly as some of the earlier function types can.
         If a sub-brick with a valid statistical type is chosen to be the threshold
         sub-brick from within \afni, then the nominal $p$-value per voxel will be
         displayed beneath the threshold slider.

         Most of these sub-brick statistical types require
         auxiliary parameters.  The list of statistical types is:\vspace{1ex}

   \centerline{\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}\hline
    Name & Type Code     & Distribution       & Auxiliary parameters \\\hline\hline
   %
    {\tt fico} & {\tt FUNC\_COR\_TYPE} & Correlation Coeff & \# Samples, \# Fit Param, \# Ort Param \\\hline
    {\tt fitt} & {\tt FUNC\_TT\_TYPE}  & Student t         &  Degrees-of-Freedom (DOF) \\\hline
    {\tt fift} & {\tt FUNC\_FT\_TYPE}  & F ratio           &  Numerator DOF, Denominator DOF \\\hline
    {\tt fizt} & {\tt FUNC\_ZT\_TYPE}  & Standard Normal   &  --- none --- \\\hline
    {\tt fict} & {\tt FUNC\_CT\_TYPE}  & Chi-Squared       &  DOF \\\hline
    {\tt fibt} & {\tt FUNC\_BT\_TYPE}  & Incomplete Beta   &  Parameters $a$ and $b$  \\\hline
    {\tt fibn} & {\tt FUNC\_BN\_TYPE}  & Binomial          &  \# Trials, Probability per trial \\\hline
    {\tt figt} & {\tt FUNC\_GT\_TYPE}  & Gamma             &  Shape, Scale \\\hline
    {\tt fipt} & {\tt FUNC\_PT\_TYPE}  & Poisson           &  Mean \\\hline
   \end{tabular}}\vspace{1ex}

         The `Name' is used on the command line when modifying the auxiliary data
         inside a dataset using the program {\tt 3drefit}.  The `Type Code' is a C macro
         for a constant that is used from within a program when modifying the
         auxiliary data.

\end{description}

In addition to the sub-brick specific keywords list, I have also added a global
keywords list that pertains to the entire dataset.  One ultimate purpose of
the keywords lists is to allow the selection of datasets and sub-bricks based
on keywords.

It is possible to attach a label and a statistical type to sub-bricks
of non-bucket datasets.  But they will have no effect.

%---------------------------------------------------------------------
\mysec{Program {\tt 3dbucket}}
At this moment, the only program that can create a bucket dataset is
{\tt 3dbucket}.  (In particular, {\tt to3d} {\it cannot\/} create
a bucket dataset!)  {\tt 3dbucket} concatenates 3D sub-bricks from
multiple input datasets and produce one output bucket dataset.
The main purpose of this program is to experiment with bucket datasets.
Its help file follows:
\begin{verbatim}
Usage: 3dbucket options
where the options are:
     -prefix pname = Use 'pname' for the output dataset prefix name.
 OR  -output pname     [default='buck']

     -session dir  = Use 'dir' for the output dataset session directory.
                       [default='./'=current working directory]
     -dry          = Execute a 'dry run'; that is, only print out
                       what would be done.  This is useful when
                       combining sub-bricks from multiple inputs.
     -verb         = Print out some verbose output as the program
                       proceeds (-dry implies -verb).
     -fbuc         = Create a functional bucket.
     -abuc         = Create an anatomical bucket.  If neither of
                       these options is given, the output type is
                       determined from the first input type.

Other arguments are taken as input datasets.  A dataset is specified
using one of the forms
   'prefix+view', 'prefix+view.HEAD', or 'prefix+view.BRIK'.
You can also add a sub-brick selection list after the end of the
dataset name.  This allows only a subset of the sub-bricks to be
included into the output (by default, all of the input dataset
is copied into the output).  A sub-brick selection list looks like
one of the following forms:
  fred+orig[5]                     ==> use only sub-brick #5
  fred+orig[5,9,17]                ==> use #5, #9, and #12
  fred+orig[5..8]     or [5-8]     ==> use #5, #6, #7, and #8
  fred+orig[5..13(2)] or [5-13(2)] ==> use #5, #7, #9, #11, and #13
Sub-brick indexes start at 0.  You can use the character '$'
to indicate the last sub-brick in a dataset; for example, you
can select every third sub-brick by using the selection list
  fred+orig[0..$(3)]

N.B.: The sub-bricks are output in the order specified, which may
 not be the order in the original datasets.  For example, using
  fred+orig[0..$(2),1..$(2)]
 will cause the sub-bricks in fred+orig to be output into the
 new dataset in an interleaved fashion.  Using
  fred+orig[$..0]
 will reverse the order of the sub-bricks in the output.

N.B.: Bucket datasets have multiple sub-bricks, but do NOT have
 a time dimension.  You can input sub-bricks from a 3D+time dataset
 into a bucket dataset.  You can use the '3dinfo' program to see
 how many sub-bricks a 3D+time or a bucket dataset contains.

N.B.: The '$', '(', ')', '[', and ']' characters are special to
 the shell, so you will have to escape them.  This is most easily
 done by putting the entire dataset plus selection list inside
 single quotes, as in 'fred+orig[5..7,9]'.
\end{verbatim}

\noindent
Some additional points:
\begin{itemize}
  \item If an input sub-brick has a statistical type, then its type
        and auxiliary parameters are copied to the output sub-brick.
        This happen if the input dataset is one of the functional
        types with a statistics threshold attached ({\it e.g.},~the
        second sub-brick from a {\tt fico} dataset).  It can also
        happen if the input dataset is itself a bucket dataset.

  \item The sub-brick labels for the output dataset are of the form
        {\tt prefix[index]}, where `{\tt prefix}' is the input
        dataset and `{\tt index}' is the integer index of the
        sub-brick in the input dataset.

  \item The output sub-brick keywords are copied from the input sub-bricks,
        if any.  The additional keyword {\tt prefix+view[index]} is also
        attached to the sub-brick keyword list.

  \item I intend to extend the input sub-brick selection scheme
        for {\tt 3dbucket} to allow selection from keyword lists.
        Eventually, it will also be possible to construct datasets
        `on-the-fly' on the command line for any program.

  \item Anatomical bucket datasets are not particularly useful,
        at least at present. (Got any ideas for applications?)
\end{itemize}

%---------------------------------------------------------------------
\mysec{Program {\tt 3drefit}}
This program lets the user change the contents of a dataset header.
It has been extended to let the sub-brick auxiliary data be modified.
Its help file follows:
\begin{verbatim}
Usage: 3drefit [options] dataset ...
where the options are
  -orient code    Sets the orientation of the 3D volume(s) in the .BRIK.
                  The code must be 3 letters, one each from the
                  pairs {R,L} {A,P} {I,S}.  The first letter gives
                  the orientation of the x-axis, the second the
                  orientation of the y-axis, the third the z-axis:
                     R = right-to-left         L = left-to-right
                     A = anterior-to-posterior P = posterior-to-anterior
                     I = inferior-to-superior  S = superior-to-inferior
               ** WARNING: when changing the orientation, you must be sure
                  to check the origins as well, to make sure that the volume
                  is positioned correctly in space.

  -xorigin distx  Puts the center of the edge voxel off at the given
  -yorigin disty  distance, for the given axis (x,y,z); distances in mm.
  -zorigin distz  (x=first axis, y=second axis, z=third axis).
                  Usually, only -zorigin makes sense.  Note that this
                  distance is in the direction given by the corresponding
                  letter in the -orient code.  For example, '-orient RAI'
                  would mean that '-zorigin 30' sets the center of the
                  first slice at 30 mm Inferior.  See the to3d manual
                  for more explanations of axes origins.
               ** SPECIAL CASE: you can use the string 'cen' in place of
                  a distance to force that axis to be re-centered.

  -xdel dimx      Makes the size of the voxel the given dimension,
  -ydel dimy      for the given axis (x,y,z); dimensions in mm.
  -zdel dimz   ** WARNING: if you change a voxel dimension, you will
                  probably have to change the origin as well.

  -TR time        Changes the TR time to a new value (see 'to3d -help').
               ** WARNING: this only applies to 3D+time datasets.

  -newid          Changes the ID code of this dataset as well.

  -statpar v ...  Changes the statistical parameters stored in this
                  dataset.  See 'to3d -help' for more details.

  -markers        Adds an empty set of AC-PC markers to the dataset,
                  if it can handle them (is anatomical, doesn't already
                  have markers, is in the +orig view, and isn't 3D+time).

  -appkey ll      Appends the string 'll' to the keyword list for the
                  whole dataset.
  -repkey ll      Replaces the keyword list for the dataset with the
                  string 'll'.
  -empkey         Destroys the keyword list for the dataset.

  -type           Changes the type of data that is declared for this
                  dataset, where 'type' is chosen from the following:
       ANATOMICAL TYPES
         spgr == Spoiled GRASS             fse == Fast Spin Echo
         epan == Echo Planar              anat == MRI Anatomy

The options below allow you to attach auxiliary data to sub-bricks
in the dataset.  Each option may be used more than once so that
multiple sub-bricks can be modified in a single run of 3drefit.

  -sublabel  n ll  Attach to sub-brick #n the label string 'll'.
  -subappkey n ll  Add to sub-brick #n the keyword string 'll'.
  -subrepkey n ll  Replace sub-brick #n's keyword string with 'll'.
  -subempkey n     Empty out sub-brick #n' keyword string

  -substatpar n type v ...
                  Attach to sub-brick #n the statistical type and
                  the auxiliary parameters given by values 'v ...',
                  where 'type' is one of the following:



         type  Description  PARAMETERS
         ----  -----------  ----------------------------------------
         fico  Cor          SAMPLES  FIT-PARAMETERS  ORT-PARAMETERS

         figt  Gamma        SHAPE and SCALE
         fipt  Poisson      MEAN
\end{verbatim}

\noindent
{\tt 3drefit} is the only program that lets the user change the
sub-brick label, keywords, and statistical parameters.  In particular,
if you don't like the default labels provided by {\tt 3dbucket},
you must use {\tt 3drefit} to patch things up.
Program {\tt 3dinfo} has been modified so that it will print
out the sub-brick auxiliary data (including keywords).  This will help guide
the use of {\tt 3drefit}.

%---------------------------------------------------------------------
\mysec{Creating Buckets in a Program}
\dline{Modifying Sub-Brick Parameters}
A number of new {\tt ADN\_} commands have been added to
{\tt EDIT\_dset\_items} in order to make creating
bucket datasets moderately painless.  In combination
with a couple of other utility routines, it is possible
to create an empty dataset with $n$ sub-bricks, attach
data arrays to them and auxiliary data to them, and even
later to expand the number of sub-bricks.

The new {\tt ADN\_} commands are described below.
(This section should be read in conjunction with \S2.7
of the \afnit plugins manual.)
The inputs to {\tt EDIT\_dset\_items} are copied into the
internal data structure of the dataset being modified,
and so can be freed or otherwise recycled after
this function return.
Bucket construction examples will be given later.

\dline{Adding Sub-Bricks to a Bucket Dataset}
In the above example, all the sub-bricks were created at once.
They were initially empty, after the first call to
{\tt EDIT\_dset\_items}, but otherwise had all the structure
needed.  After a sub-brick has an actual data array attached
to it, the {\tt ADN\_nvals} code can no longer be used to
change the number of sub-bricks in dataset.

If a dataset already has actual data attached to any of its
sub-bricks, another method must be used to add a new sub-brick:
\begin{verbatim}
  short * qbar ;
  float   qfac ;
  EDIT_add_brick( new_dset , MRI_short , qfac , qbar ) ;
\end{verbatim}
will create a new sub-brick in the dataset, with data
type {\tt short}, scale factor {\tt qfac}, and data
array {\tt qbar}.  (The pointer {\tt qbar} is just
copied into the sub-brick---the data it points to
now `belongs' to the dataset and should not be freed
by you!)  If you wish to attach a label, keywords, or
statistical parameters to this new brick, you would
do this using {\tt EDIT\_dset\_items} (using the
correct index for the new sub-brick).

Note that if you are doing this to a 3D+time dataset,
as opposed to a bucket dataset, then a little more
needs to be done.  See {\tt plug\_realtime.c} for
an example of how the \afnit real-time system uses
{\tt EDIT\_add\_brick} to grow a 3D+time dataset
during image acquisition.

\dline{Accessing Sub-Brick Data}
The following {\tt C} macros can be used to access the contents
of sub-bricks and their associated data.
The argument {\tt ds} is a pointer to a dataset {\tt struct},
and the argument {\tt iv} is a sub-brick index.

\mysec{Changes in \afni}
If the active datasets are buckets, then the set of choosers
in the {\tt Define Function} control panel changes.  The
figure below shows the new bucket sub-brick choosers on the
left; the old style sub-brick choosers are shown on the right
for comparison (these are used with the non-bucket dataset types).\vspace{1ex}

\centerline{\epsfxsize=2.5in\epsffile{bucket_bb.eps}

            \epsfxsize=2.5in\epsffile{bucket_nb.eps}}

            \blob\blob\blob
            \makebox[2.5in]{\sf With old-style choosers}}\vspace{1ex}

Note that any sub-brick of a bucket dataset can be used as a
threshold.  This is true even if it does not have statistical
parameters attached.  (In that case, no $p$-value can be
computed, of course.)

Two new buttons have been added to the \fbox{\tt Misc} menu under the {\tt Define Datamode} control panel:
\fbox{\tt Anat Info} and \fbox{\tt Func Info}.
These buttons will popup message windows with the output of
program {\tt 3dinfo} about the current anatomical and functional datasets.
This is to help look up keywords and statistical types of sub-bricks.
In addition, the \fbox{FIM} button has been removed from the
{\tt Define Function} control panel.

\mysec{Still to Come}
Things that are needed:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A generic function for converting a 3D+time dataset into
        a bucket dataset ({\it \`a~la} {\tt PLUTO\_4D\_to\_typed\_fim}).
  \item Routines to deal with keyword lists, and a mechanism to
        allow the user to select sub-bricks (and datasets) based on keywords.
  \item A mechanism to allow the user to assemble datasets `on-the-fly'
        using keyword and/or sub-brick index criteria.  (A~generalization
        of the syntax of {\tt 3dbucket} is a possibility.)
  \item Applications that create buckets ({\it e.g.}, multiple regression, \ldots).
