Please do use these tests if you do some libmpeg2 changes.

* get the official suite of mpeg2 torture tests at
http://www.linuxvideo.org/mpeg2dec/files/mpeg2dec-streams.tar.gz

or using CVS :

# export CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs.linuxvideo.org:/cvs/livid
# cvs login (Just press Return when prompted for a password)
# cvs checkout mpeg2dec-streams

(OK, I did some reorganization work on the archive, so its not really the
official suite anymore)

* extract this archive at the same level as your mpeg2dec directory :
in your working directory you should have subdirectories mpeg2dec and
mpeg2dec-streams.

* change the "tests" file to indicate where you put these streams

* set HACK_MODE 2 in libmpeg2/mpeg2_internal.h, because pgm and md5
output modes currently only works with this change

* go in the conformance directory and run ./regression <test> <idct>

<test> is the name of the test suite you want to use. For the official
mpeg video conformance tests, just use "tests".

<idct> is the type of IDCT you are using. If your machine supports MMX,
choose "mmx". If your machine uses the c idct, choose "c"

That's it...
