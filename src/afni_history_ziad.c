/*  (for starting a new file, search for CHANGE)

    basic format: 3-field date, user, program_name, impact_level,
                  short description without newline
                  (optional) long descrption with intermediate newlines
  
    copy entire section: { ... } ,
  
    Notes: - months are JAN ... DEC (see afni_history.h)

           - levels are :
                    MICRO           - users don't see
                    MINOR           - small affect on users
                    MAJOR           - larger affect on users
                    SUPER           - important changes, like new programs
                    SUPERDUPER      - we expect users to know

           - types are:
                    TYPE_GENERAL    - unspecified update type
                    TYPE_NEW_PROG   - new program
                    TYPE_NEW_OPT    - new program option
                    TYPE_NEW_ENV    - new environment variable or change
                    TYPE_BUG_FIX    - bug fix
                    TYPE_MODIFY     - a change (not new, not a fix)

           - PLEASE, stick to what fits on an 80 column terminal
           - it may be nice to put the newest entires at the top
           - leave the last "99, NULL" entry as it is

 -- example --

 { 26 , FEB , 2008 , ZSS , "my_program" , MAJOR ,
   "short description of change" ,
   "(optional) description of where to get more information\n"
   "   - with newlines, if you babble for multiple lines\n"
   "   (but none at the end)"

/* Ponderosos:
   -----------
   - Every bone of my body shivers with excitement at the
   thought of adding a type variable :
   { NA, NEW_PROG, NEW_OPT, NEW_ENV, BUG_FIX }
   It would allow users to check for new things easily.
   And it might help eradicate misery from this world.
   Did I also mention that it can fit on the first line
   beautfully, right after the short string? WOW!
   - We should probably start building a program list. To make sure 
   that we have no typos there. We can have users add to that list 
   whenever they introduce a program for the first time. This way 
   nobody has to do it at once. 
   - Also, we need to have special 'program names' like: 
   "afni-general", "suma-general", "general"
   or perhaps
   "AFNI", "SUMA", "ALL"
   these would be used to refer to package-wide changes.
