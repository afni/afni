-------------------------------------------------------------------------

    This program converts a p-value to a statistic of choice, with
    reference to a particular dataset.

    Often to convert a p-value to a statistic, supplementary
    information is needed, such as number of degrees of freedom.  AFNI
    programs that write statistics do store that info in headers, and
    this program is meant to be a useful to do conversions based on
    that: the user provides the p-value and the specific [i]th brick
    of the dataset in question, and a single number is output to
    screen.

    This program should give equivalent results to other AFNI programs
    like ccalc and cdf, but with less work by the user.

    **Note that the user will have to choose explicitly whether they
      are doing one-sided or two-sided testing!** This is equivalent
      to choosing "Pos&Neg" or just "Pos" (or just "Neg", if the user
      multiplies the output by a negative) in the AFNI GUI's clickable
      p-to-statistic calculator.

    Ver. $version (PA Taylor, ${rev_dat})

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

  RUNNING:

  $this_prog  \
        -inset   DDD'[i]'                     \
        -pval    P                            \
        -2sided|-1sided                       \
        {-quiet}

  where:
    -inset  DDD'[i]'
               :specify a dataset DDD and, if it has multiple sub-bricks,
                the [i]th subbrick with the statistic of interest MUST
                be selected explicitly; note the use of quotation marks 
                around the brick selector (because of the square-brackets).

    -pval  P   :input p-value P, which MUST be in the interval [0,1].

    -2sided
       or
    -1sided    :one of these two options MUST be chosen, and it is up
                to the researcher to choose which.

    -quiet     :an optional flag so that output ONLY the final statistic
                value output to standard output; this can be then be
                viewed, redirected to a text file or saved as a shell
                variable.  (Default: display supplementary text.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

  OUTPUTS: 

    The types of statistic values that can be calculated are:
        corr coef, t-stat, F-stat or z-score.

    If "-quiet" is used, then basically just a single number (the
    converted statistic value) is output.  See examples for saving
    this in a file or variable. (A 3dinfo message shown is ignorable
    and won't affect saving/writing the variable.)

    Without the "-quiet" option, some descriptive text is also output
    with the calculation, stating what kind of statistic is being
    output, etc.  

    If you want to know more about the cryptic outputs in the
    non-quiet usage of this program, you may look upon "BRICK_STATAUX"
    on this webpage:
    https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/doc/program_help/README.attributes.html
    and tremble.

  EXAMPLES:

    In all cases note the use of the single quotes around the subbrick
    selector-- these are necessary!

    # 1) Do a calculation and display various informations to screen:
    $this_prog  \
        -inset stats.sub01+tlrc'[2]'            \
        -pval 0.001                             \
        -2sided
    
    # 2) Do a calculation and just display a single number:
    $this_prog  \
        -inset stats.sub01+tlrc'[2]'            \
        -pval 0.0005                            \
        -1sided                                 \
        -quiet

    # 3) Do a calculation and store the output number as a variable,
    #    using tcsh syntax:
    set my_stat = \`$this_prog  \
                    -inset stats.sub02+tlrc'[8]'            \
                    -pval 0.001                             \
                    -2sided                                 \
                    -quiet\`

    # 4) Do a calculation and store the output number into a text
    #    file:
    $this_prog  \
        -inset stats.sub02+tlrc'[8]'            \
        -pval 0.001                             \
        -2sided                                 \
        -quiet > MY_STAT_FILE.txt
