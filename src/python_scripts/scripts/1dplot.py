# + [PT] Implement Reynoldian-Reschian solution to the problem of
#   getting an interactive backend session by default on Biowulf: if
#   DISPLAY isn't detected, the set our own MPLBACKEND value, in order
#   to avoid getting an interactive one like QtAgg that would crash.
#
#version   = "1.4"; date  = "Mar 20, 2019"
# + [RR] Test directly against MPLBACKEND rather than DISPLAY, so the
#   default backend will be agg, unless the user specifies otherwise.
#   DISPLAY is inherited, even if children shells no longer have access
#   to it.
