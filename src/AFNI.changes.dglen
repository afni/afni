22 Nov 2005
 * support for user options for level of Gaussian smoothing (-sigma1, -sigma2) in 3danisosmooth
29 Nov 2005
 * removed default author and version info for 3dMax. Now option -ver gives that
 output. 3dMax is used in scripts, so that change confuses everything.
14 Dec 2005
 * added new options to 3danisosmooth for avoiding negative numbers and
 fractional control of amount of edginess. 2D exponential method gives faster
 results because of new constant and switched phi values.

 duplication of .nii or .nii.gz suffix in file names.
 * 3dDWItoDT can now make separate files for each type of output data to make it
 easier to work with other packages. Lower diagonal order used for Dtensor to
 make compliant with NIFTI standard in 3dDWItoDT and 3dDTeig.

 files for eigenvalues, vectors, FA, MD (like 3dDWItoDT).
