The crorden/dcm2niix_console directory is (almost *) a duplication
of the 'console' directory from:

   https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix

current version: v1.0.20240202
(as defined by kDCMdate in nii_dicom.h)

   * modified makefile to remove -sectcreate from mac CFLAGS
     (we will ponder Apple signing later)


initial date: 25 Apr 2017    - Thank you, Chris Rorden!
