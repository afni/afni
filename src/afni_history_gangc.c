    Notes: - months are JAN ... DEC (see afni_history.h)

           - levels are :
                    MICRO           - users don't see
                    MINOR           - small affect on users
                    MAJOR           - larger affect on users
                    SUPER           - important changes, like new programs
                    SUPERDUPER      - we expect users to know

           - types are:
                    TYPE_GENERAL    - unspecified update type
                    TYPE_NEW_PROG   - new program
                    TYPE_NEW_OPT    - new program option
                    TYPE_NEW_ENV    - new environment variable or change
                    TYPE_BUG_FIX    - bug fix
                    TYPE_MODIFY     - a change (not new, not a fix)

           - PLEASE, stick to what fits on an 80 column terminal
           - it may be nice to put the newest entires at the top
           - leave the last "99, NULL" entry as it is
