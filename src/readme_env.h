   "Unix Environment Variables Used by AFNI\n" ,
   "=======================================\n" ,
   "The AFNI program allows you to use several Unix environment variables\n" ,
   "to influence its behavior. The mechanics of setting an environment\n" ,
   "variable depend on which shell you are using. To set an environment\n" ,
   "variable named \"FRED\" to the string \"Elvis\":\n" ,
   "\n" ,
   "   csh or tcsh:  setenv FRED Elvis\n" ,
   "   bash or ksh:  FRED=Elvis ; export FRED\n" ,
   "\n" ,
   "Normally, these commands would go in your .cshrc or .profile files,\n" ,
   "so that they would be invoked when you login. If in doubt, consult\n" ,
   "your local Unix guru. If you don't have one, well....\n" ,
   "\n" ,
   "You don't NEED to set any of these variables -- AFNI will still work\n" ,
   "correctly. But they are an easy way to set up certain defaults to\n" ,
   "make AFNI a little easier on your neocortex and hippocampus.\n" ,
   "\n" ,
   "N.B.: Changes to environment variables AFTER you start a program will\n" ,
   "      not be seen by that program, since each running program gets\n" ,
   "      a private copy of the entire set of environment variables when\n" ,
   "      it starts. This is a standard Unix feature, and is not specific\n" ,
   "      to AFNI. Some variables can be set internally in AFNI using\n" ,
   "      the \"Edit Environment\" control from the \"Datamode->Misc\" menu\n" ,
   "      or from the image window Button-3 popup menu. Such variables\n" ,
   "      are marked with \"(editable)\" in the descriptions below.\n" ,
   "\n" ,
   "N.B.: Some variables below are described as being of \"YES/NO\" type.\n" ,
   "      This means that they should either be set to the value \"YES\"\n" ,
   "      or to the value \"NO\".\n" ,
   "\n" ,
   "N.B.: You can now set environment variables on the 'afni' command\n" ,
   "      line; for example:\n" ,
   "        afni -DAFNI_SESSTRAIL=3 -DAFNI_FUNC_ALPHA=YES\n" ,
   "      This may be useful for a 'one time' situation, or as an alias.\n" ,
   "      You can also use this '-Dname=val' option in 1dplot and 3dDeconvolve.\n" ,
   "      -- RWCox - 22 Mar 2005\n" ,
   "      And now you can use this feature on most program command lines.\n" ,
   "      -- RWCox - 13 Dec 2007\n" ,
   "\n" ,
   "N.B.: At the end of this file is a list of several environment variables\n" ,
   "      that affect the program 3dDeconvolve, rather than the interactive\n" ,
   "      AFNI program itself.\n" ,
   "\n" ,
   "N.B.: If you set an AFNI environment variable on the command line, or\n" ,
   "      in a shell startup file (e.g., ~/.cshrc), and also have that\n" ,
   "      variable in your ~/.afnirc file, you will get a warning telling\n" ,
   "      you that the value in the ~/.afnirc file is being ignored.\n" ,
   "      To turn off these warnings, set environment variable\n" ,
   "      AFNI_ENVIRON_WARNINGS to NO.\n" ,
   "\n" ,
   "N.B.: You can allow the .afnirc file to re-set existing environment\n" ,
   "      variables by setting environment variable AFNI_ENVIRON_RESET to YES.\n" ,

   "A few other programs in the AFNI package also read the ***ENVIRONMENT\n" ,
   "section of the .afnirc file. This is needed so that environment settings\n" ,

   "constants from X11 resources (usually in your .Xdefaults or .Xresources\n" ,
   "file, and described in file AFNI.Xdefaults) has been modified to also\n" ,
   "allow the same constants to be set from Unix environment variables.\n" ,
   "For example, the gap (in pixels) between sub-graphs is set by the\n" ,

   "          AFNI_VIEW_FUNC_BRICK (editable)\n" ,
   "------------------------------\n" ,
   "One of the (very few) confusing parts of AFNI is the \"warp-on-demand\"\n" ,
   "viewing of transformed datasets (e.g., in the +tlrc coordinate system).\n" ,
   "This allows you to look at slices taken from transformed volumes without\n" ,
   "actually computing and storing the entire transformed dataset. This\n" ,
   "viewing mode is controlled by from the \"Define Datamode\" control panel.\n" ,
   "When an anatomical dataset has a +tlrc.BRIK file, then you can choose\n" ,
   "between \"View Anat Data Brick\" and \"Warp Anat on Demand\"; when there\n" ,
   "is no +tlrc.BRIK file for the dataset, then only \"Warp Anat on Demand\"\n" ,
   "is possible.\n" ,
   "\n" ,
   "If you switch the Talairach view when the current anat dataset does\n" ,
   "not have a +tlrc.BRIK file, then the \"Warp Anat on Demand\" mode will\n" ,
   "be turned on. If you then switch to a dataset that does have a\n" ,
   "+tlrc.BRIK file, \"Warp Anat on Demand\" will still be turned on,\n" ,
   "although the \"View Anat Data Brick\" option will be enabled.\n" ,
   "\n" ,
   "If you set the YES/NO variable AFNI_VIEW_ANAT_BRICK to YES,\n" ,
   "then \"View Anat Data Brick\" will be turned on whenever possible after\n" ,
   "switching datasets. Similarly, setting AFNI_VIEW_FUNC_BRICK to YES\n" ,
   "will engage \"View Func Data Brick\" whenever possible (when the BRIK\n" ,
   "file exists and its grid spacing matches the anatomical grid spacing).\n" ,
   "Note that switching any dataset (func or anat) triggers the same\n" ,
   "routine, and will set either or both \"View Brick\" modes on. When\n" ,
   "these environment variables are present, the only way to switch to\n" ,
   "\"Warp\" mode when \"View Brick\" mode is possible is to do it manually\n" ,
   "(by clicking on the toggle button) when you want this.\n" ,
   "\n" ,
   "When you use one of the drawing plugins (\"Draw Dataset\" or \"Gyrus\n" ,
   "Finder\"), you must operate directly on the dataset BRIK. For this\n" ,
   "reason, it is important to be in \"View Data Brick\" mode on these\n" ,
   "occasions. Setting these variables is one way to ensure that this\n" ,
   "will happen whenever possible.\n" ,
   "\n" ,
   "When AFNI is in \"Warp Anat on Demand\" mode, the word \"{warp}\" will\n" ,
   "appear in the windows' titlebars. This provides a reminder of the\n" ,

   "Variable: TMPDIR\n" ,
   "----------------\n" ,
   "This variable specifies the directory where temporary files are to be\n" ,

   "You must have permission to write into this directory. If you want to\n" ,

   "----------------------------\n" ,
   "If this variable is set, it is the name of a file to be read like the\n" ,

   "\n" ,
   "--------------------------\n" ,
   "Variable: AFNI_LAYOUT_FILE\n" ,
   "--------------------------\n" ,
   "If defined, this variable is the name of a file to read at startup\n" ,
   "to define the \"layout\" of AFNI windows at the program start. If\n" ,
   "this name starts with a '/' character, then it is an absolute path;\n" ,
   "otherwise, it is taken to be a path relative to the user's home\n" ,
   "directory ($HOME). If the AFNI command line switch \"-layout\" is\n" ,
   "used, it will override this specification.\n" ,
   "\n" ,
   "The simplest way to produce a layout file is to use the \"Save Layout\"\n" ,
   "button on the Datamode->Misc menu. You can then edit this file;\n" ,
   "the format should be fairly self-explanatory. The structure of the\n" ,
   "file is similar to the .afnirc file (cf. README.setup). In fact,\n" ,
   "the layout file can be included into .afnirc (since it is just another\n" ,
   "*** section) and then setting AFNI_LAYOUT_FILE = .afnirc in the\n" ,
   "***ENVIRONMENT section should work.\n" ,
   "\n" ,
   "A sample layout file:\n" ,
   "\n" ,
   "***LAYOUT\n" ,
   " A               geom=+73+1106                 // start controller A\n" ,

   "\n" ,
   "Each window to be opened has a separate command line in this file.\n" ,
   "The \"geom=\" qualifiers specify the size and position of the windows.\n" ,
   "For images, \"ifrac=\" can be used to specify the fraction of the window\n" ,
   "occupied by the image (if \"ifrac=1.0\", then no control widgets will be\n" ,
   "visible). For graphs, \"matrix=\" can be used to control the initial\n" ,
   "number of sub-graphs displayed. For plugins, the label on the button\n" ,
   "that starts the plugin is used after the \".plugin.\" string (blanks\n" ,
   "should be filled with underscores \"_\"). In the example above, the last\n" ,
   "two windows to be opened do not have a \"geom=\" qualifier, so their\n" ,
   "placement will be chosen by the window manager.\n" ,
   "\n" ,
   "If you add \"slow\" after the \"***LAYOUT\", then each window operation\n" ,
   "will be paused for 1 second to let you watch the layout operations\n" ,
   "proceed gradually. Otherwise, they will be executed as fast as\n" ,
   "possible (which still may not be all that fast).\n" ,
   "\n" ,
   "Using layouts with a window manager that requires user placement\n" ,
   "of new windows (e.g., twm) is a futile and frustrating exercise.\n" ,
   "\n" ,
   "If you do NOT have any layout file defined, then AFNI will choose\n" ,
   "a layout for you that includes opening image viewers. Some people\n" ,
   "find this very annoying. The simplest way to avoid this annoyance\n" ,
   "is to set AFNI_LAYOUT_FILE to a name of a file that doesn't exist\n" ,
   "(e.g., 'ElvisIsAliveOnPlanetZork'). The reason for this default\n" ,
   "layout behavior (added Dec 2010) is that we received complaints\n" ,
   "that novice users were finding AFNI too confusing on startup.\n" ,
   "(Hard to believe, but true.)\n" ,

   "-------------------------\n" ,
   "Related to the above, if you set this environment variable (in the\n" ,

   "to set the geometry of the plotting windows used for time series\n" ,
   "plots, histograms, etc. -- all the graphs except the dataset plots.\n" ,
   "Its format should be something like \"550x350\"; this example sets\n" ,
