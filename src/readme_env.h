   "Unix Environment Variables Used by AFNI\n" ,
   "=======================================\n" ,
   "The AFNI program allows you to use several Unix environment variables\n" ,
   "to influence its behavior.  The mechanics of setting an environment\n" ,
   "variable depend on which shell you are using.  To set an environment\n" ,
   "variable named \"FRED\" to the string \"Elvis\":\n" ,
   "\n" ,
   "   csh or tcsh:  setenv FRED Elvis\n" ,
   "   bash or ksh:  FRED=Elvis ; export FRED\n" ,
   "\n" ,
   "Normally, these commands would go in your .cshrc or .profile files,\n" ,
   "so that they would be invoked when you login.  If in doubt, consult\n" ,
   "your local Unix guru.  If you don't have one, well....\n" ,
   "\n" ,
   "You don't NEED to set any of these variables -- AFNI will still work\n" ,
   "correctly.  But they are an easy way to set up certain defaults to\n" ,
   "make AFNI a little easier on your neocortex and hippocampus.\n" ,
   "\n" ,
   "N.B.: Changes to environment variables AFTER you start a program will\n" ,
   "      not be seen by that program, since each running program gets\n" ,
   "      a private copy of the entire set of environment variables when\n" ,
   "      it starts.  This is a standard Unix feature, and is not specific\n" ,
   "      to AFNI.  Some variables can be set internally in AFNI using\n" ,
   "      the \"Edit Environment\" control from the \"Datamode->Misc\" menu\n" ,
   "      or from the image window Button-3 popup menu.  Such variables\n" ,
   "      are marked with \"(editable)\" in the descriptions below.\n" ,
   "\n" ,
   "N.B.: Some variables below are described as being of \"YES/NO\" type.\n" ,
   "      This means that they should either be set to the value \"YES\"\n" ,
   "      or to the value \"NO\".\n" ,
   "\n" ,
   "N.B.: You can now set environment variables on the 'afni' command\n" ,
   "      line; for example:\n" ,
   "        afni -DAFNI_EDGIZE_OVERLAY=YES -DAFNI_SESSTRAIL=3\n" ,
   "      This may be useful for a 'one time' situation, or as an alias.\n" ,
   "      You can also use this '-Dname=val' option in 1dplot and 3dDeconvolve.\n" ,
   "      -- RWCox - 22 Mar 2005\n" ,
   "      And now you can use this feature on most program command lines.\n" ,
   "      -- RWCox - 13 Dec 2007\n" ,
   "\n" ,
   "N.B.: At the end of this file is a list of several environment variables\n" ,
   "      that affect the program 3dDeconvolve, rather than the interactive\n" ,
   "      AFNI program itself.\n" ,
   "\n" ,
   "N.B.: If you set an AFNI environment variable on the command line, or\n" ,
   "      in a shell startup file (e.g., ~/.cshrc), and also have that\n" ,
   "      variable in your ~/.afnirc file, you will get a warning telling\n" ,
   "      you that the value in the ~/.afnirc file is being ignored.\n" ,
   "      To turn off these warnings, set environment variable\n" ,
   "      AFNI_ENVIRON_WARNINGS to NO.\n" ,

   "-------------------------\n" ,
   "This variable is used to control automatic compression of .BRIK files on\n" ,

   "respectively invoke programs \"compress\", \"gzip\", and \"bzip2\" (the program\n" ,

   "equal to one of these, then all AFNI programs will automatically pass\n" ,
   ".BRIK data through the appropriate compression program as it is written\n" ,
   "to disk.  Note that this will slow down dataset write operations.  Note\n" ,
   "also that compressed datasets cannot be mapped directly from disk into\n" ,
   "memory ('mmap'), but must occupy actual memory (RAM) and swap space.  For\n" ,
   "more details, see file README.compression.\n" ,
   "\n" ,
   "Note that compressed (.BRIK.Z, .BRIK.gz, and .BRIK.bz2) datasets will\n" ,

   "Variable: AFNI_BYTEORDER\n" ,
   "------------------------\n" ,
   "This variable is used to control the byte order for output files.\n" ,
   "If you use it, the two legal values are \"LSB_FIRST\" and \"MSB_FIRST\".\n" ,
   "If you don't use it, the default order on your CPU will be used.\n" ,
   "The main purpose of this would be if you were using a mixture of\n" ,
   "CPU types reading shared disks (i.e., using NFS).  If the majority\n" ,
   "of the systems were MSB_FIRST (e.g., SGI, HP, Sun), but there were\n" ,
   "a few LSB_FIRST systems (e.g., Intel, DEC Alpha), then you might\n" ,
   "want to do 'setenv AFNI_BYTEORDER MSB_FIRST' on all of the MSB_FIRST\n" ,
   "systems to make sure that the datasets that they write out are\n" ,
   "readable by the other computers.\n" ,
   "\n" ,
   "Note that AFNI programs can now check the .HEAD file for the byte\n" ,
   "order of a dataset, and will swap the bytes on input, if needed.\n" ,
   "If you wish to mark all of the datasets on a given system as\n" ,

   "The value of this variable is only used for old datasets that do\n" ,
   "not have the byte order encoded in their headers.  If this variable\n" ,
   "is not present, then the CPU native byte order is used.  If this\n" ,
   "variable is present, and its value differs from the native byte\n" ,
   "order, then 2 byte dataset BRIKs (short) are 2-swapped (as in\n" ,
   "\"ab\" -> \"ba\") when they are read from disk, and 4 byte datasets\n" ,

   "Variable: AFNI_NOMMAP\n" ,
   "---------------------\n" ,
   "This YES/NO variable can be used to turn off the mmap feature by which\n" ,
   "AFNI can load datasets into memory using the map-file-to-memory\n" ,
   "functionality of Unix.  (Dataset .BRIK files will only be mmap-ed if\n" ,
   "they are not compressed and are in the native byte order of the CPU.)\n" ,
   "On some systems, mmap doesn't seem to work very well (e.g., Linux kernel\n" ,
   "version 1.2.13).  You can disable mmap by 'setenv AFNI_NOMMAP YES'.\n" ,
   "\n" ,
   "The penalty for disabling mmap is that all datasets must be loaded\n" ,
   "into actual RAM.  AFNI does not have the ability to load a dataset\n" ,
   "only partially, so if a 20 Megabyte .BRIK file is accessed, all of\n" ,
   "it will be loaded into RAM.  With mmap, the Unix operating system will\n" ,
   "decide how much of the file to load.  In this way, it is possible to\n" ,
   "deal with more files than you have swap space on your computer\n" ,
   "(since .BRIK files are mmap-ed in readonly mode).\n" ,
   "\n" ,
   "The moral of the story: buy more memory, it's cheap.  At the time\n" ,
