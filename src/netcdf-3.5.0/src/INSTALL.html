<h1>Installing NetCDF</h1>

<p><em>(The latest version of this document is available at <a
href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/INSTALL.html">http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/INSTALL.html</a>.</em></p>

<p>This document contains instructions for building and installing
the netCDF package from source on various platforms. Prebuilt
binary releases are (or soon will be) available for various platforms from <a
href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/binaries.html">http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/binaries.html</a>.</p>

<p>If you wish to report problems encountered during the installation of this
package, see <a
href="#ReportingProblems">Reporting Problems</a> below.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>Depending on the platform, you may need up to 25 Mbytes of free
space to unpack, build, and run the tests. You will also need a
Standard C compiler. If you have compilers for FORTRAN 77, FORTRAN
90, or C++, the corresponding netCDF language interfaces may also
be built and tested.</p>

<p>If you wish to build from source on a Windows (Win32) platform,
different instructions apply. Obtain the file <a
href="ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/netcdf/contrib/win32/maks.zip">
ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/netcdf/contrib/win32/maks.zip</a>,
unpack it in the netCDF src/ directory, and read WIN32_INSTALL.</p>

<h2>Specifying the Environment for Building</h2>

<p>
Select and specify an appropriate build environment.
If necessary,
set whichever of the
environment variables CC, CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS, FC, FFLAGS, CXX, CXXFLAGS,
F90, and F90FLAGS are needed to represent that
environment.
<p>If you don't set an environment variable, the
<code>configure</code> script will try to figure out a reasonable
value.
(See <a href="#SetEnvVar">Setting Environment
Variables</a> to learn how to set environment variables.)</p>

The section marked <a href="#TestedSystems">Tested
Systems</a> below contains a list of systems on which we have built
this package, the environment variable settings we used, and
additional commentary.
</p>

<h2>Running the <code>configure</code> Script</h2>

<p>To create the Makefiles needed to build netCDF, you must run the
provided <code>configure</code> script.  Go to the top-level netCDF
src/ directory.</p>

<p>Decide where you want to install this package. Use this for the
"<code>--prefix=</code>" argument to the
<code>configure</code> script below. The default installation prefix
is "..", which will install the package's files in
../bin, ../lib, and ../man relative to the netCDF src/
directory.</p>

<p>Execute the <code>configure</code> script:</p>

<pre>
    ./configure --prefix=<em>whatever_you_decided</em>
</pre>

<p>The "<code>--prefix=...</code>" specification is
optional; if omitted, "<code>..</code>" designating the
parent directory will be used as a default.</p>

 

<p>The <code>configure</code> script will examine your computer
system -- checking for attributes that are relevant to building the
netCDF package. It will print to standard output the checks that it
makes and the results that it finds.</p>

<p>The <code>configure</code> script will also create the file
"config.log", which will contain error messages from the
utilities that the <code>configure</code> script uses in examining
the attributes of your system. Because such an examination can
result in errors, it is <em>expected</em> that
"config.log" will contain error messages. Therefore, such
messages do not necessarily indicate a problem (a better indicator
would be failure of the subsequent "make"). One
exception, however, is an error message in "config.log"
that indicates that a compiler could not be started. This indicates
a severe problem in your compilation environment -- one that you
must fix.</p>

<p>Run "<code>make</code>". This will build one or more netCDF
libraries. It will build the basic netCDF library libsrc/libnetcdf.a.
If you have Fortran 77 or Fortran 90 compilers, then the Fortran
interfaces will be included in this library. If you have a C++
compiler, then the C++ interface will be built into the library
cxx/libnetcdf_c++.a. This will also build the netCDF utilities
ncgen(1) and ncdump(1).</p>

<h2>Testing and Installing the Release</h2>

<p>Run "<code>make test</code>" to verify that the netCDF library and
executables have been built properly. This will build and run various
test programs that test the C, Fortran, and C++ interfaces as well as
the "ncdump" and "ncgen" utility programs.  Lines in the output
beginning with "***" report on success or failure of the tests; any
failures will be reported before halting the test.  Compiler and
linker warnings during the testing may be ignored.  </p>

<p>To install the libraries and executables, run "<code>make
install</code>".  Try linking your applications.  Let us know if you
have problems (see <a href="#ReportingProblems">Reporting Problems</a>
below).  Port the library to other platforms.  Share data.</p>

<h3><a id="TestedSystems" name="TestedSystems">Tested Systems</a></h3>

<p>The following are environment variable settings that we've used to
build netCDF-3 on various systems -- plus commentary. Take your pick
if there is more than one set of settings for a particular system.
For some platforms we have provided a simple setting for building the
library and another setting that uses optimization flags (though
optimization may not make much difference for an I/O library).  On
some platforms compilers emit harmless warning messages, which you can
safely ignore unless the tests performed in the "make test" step fail.
</p>

<p>If you don't find your environment listed here, then try <a
href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/other-builds.html">
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/other-builds.html</a>
for reports of successful builds of this package in environments to
which we had no access.</p>

<h2>Porting Notes</h2>

<p>The configure and build system should work on any system which
has a modern "sh" shell, "make", and so on. The
configure and build system is less portable than the "C"
code itself, however. You may run into problems with the
"include" syntax in the Makefiles. You can use GNU make
to overcome this, or simply manually include the specified files
after running <code>configure</code>.</p>

 

<p>If you can't run the <code>configure</code> script, you will
need to create libsrc/ncconfig.h and fortran/nfconfig.inc. Start
with libsrc/ncconfig.in and fortran/nfconfig.in and set the defines
as appropriate for your system.</p>

<p>Operating system dependency is isolated in the "ncio"
module. We provide two versions. posixio.c uses POSIX system calls
like "open()", "read()" and "write().
ffio.c uses a special library available on CRAY systems. You could
create other versions for different operating systems. The program
"t_ncio.c" can be used as a simple test of this
layer.</p>

<p>Numerical representation dependency is isolated in the
"ncx" module. As supplied, ncx.m4 (ncx.c) supports IEEE
floating point representation, VAX floating point, and CRAY
floating point. BIG_ENDIAN vs LITTLE_ENDIAN is handled, as well as
various sizes of "int", "short", and
"long". We assume, however, that a "char" is
eight bits.</p>

<p>There is a separate implementation of the ncx interface
available as ncx_cray.c which contains optimizations for CRAY
vector architectures. Move the generic ncx.c out of the way and
rename ncx_cray.c to ncx.c to use this module. By default, this
module does not use the IEG2CRAY and CRAY2IEG library calls. When
compiled with aggressive inlining and optimization, it provides
equivalent functionality with comparable speed and clearer error
semantics. If you wish to use the IEG library functions, compile
this module with -DUSE_IEG.</p>

<h2><a id="SetEnvVar" name="SetEnvVar">Setting Environment Variables</a></h2>
<p>
If you don't know what environment variables are or how to set them,
then read this section; otherwise, you may safely skip it.
</p>
<p>
An environment variable is a named parameter that is managed by a user's
shell program and which the shell makes available to the utilities that
it executes (for example, a <code>configure</code> script).  The following are examples of
typical environment variables:
</p>
<pre>
        NAME                    EXAMPLE VALUE
        ----                    -------------
        USER                    steve
        HOME                    /home/steve
        PATH                    /bin:/usr/bin:/home/steve/bin
</pre>
<p>
You may obtain a listing of your environment variables by executing the
command "env".
</p>
<p>
The way in which an environment variable is defined and set depends upon
the shell the user is using.  A user of a csh-like shell (e.g. csh,
tcsh) might do the following:
<pre>
    % setenv CC c89
    % setenv CPPFLAGS "-O -DNDEBUG"
</pre>
whereas, the user of the standard UNIX shell (e.g. sh, ksh, bash) might,
equivalently, do the following:
<pre>
    $ export CC=c89
    $ export CPPFLAGS="-O -DNDEBUG"
</pre>
In both cases, the quotes above are necessary to delimit a value that
contains embedded whitespace.  They do not, however, become part of
the value.
</p>
<p>
A user of a standard shell has an additional, shorthand method for
defining and setting environment variables for just a single command.
Environment variables can be defined and set on the command-line and
take effect for only that command.  For example
<pre>
    $ export FOO=foo
    $ env | grep FOO
    FOO=foo
    $ FOO=bar env | grep FOO
    FOO=bar
    $ env | grep FOO
    FOO=foo
</pre>
</p>
<p>
For tested systems, environment variables and their
values are given as if listed by the "env" utility.  Users of the
standard UNIX shell may use the syntax directly; whereas, users of a
csh-like shell should convert the syntax to that expected by the shell.
For example, a standard shell user might do the following (taken from
the SunOS 5.6 example):
<pre>
    $ CC=/opt/SUNWspro/bin/c89 CPPFLAGS=-DNDEBUG CFLAGS=-O \
    FC=/opt/SUNWspro/bin/f77 FFLAGS="-O -erroff=WDECL_LOCAL_NOTUSED" \
    CXX=/opt/SUNWspro/bin/CC ./configure >configure.log 2>&1
</pre>
whereas a csh-like shell user would, equivalently, do the following:
<pre>
    % setenv CC /opt/SUNWspro/bin/c89
    % setenv CPPFLAGS "-DNDEBUG"
    % setenv CFLAGS -O
    % setenv FC /opt/SUNWspro/bin/f77
    % setenv FFLAGS "-O -erroff=WDECL_LOCAL_NOTUSED"
    % setenv CXX /opt/SUNWspro/bin/CC
    % ./configure >&! configure.log
</pre>
</p>
<p>
More information on environment variables can be found in the manual
page for your shell (e.g. "man csh", "man ksh").
