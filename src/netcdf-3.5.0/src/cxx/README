netcdfcpp.h	the C++ interface

netcdf.cpp	the implementation of the interface, on top of the current
		C library interface

nctst.cpp	a test program for the interface that creates a netCDF file
		and then dumps out its contents in ASCII form to stdout.
		This example may also be helpful in understanding how the
		interface is intended to be used.

example.c	example of C code needed to create a small netCDF file

example.cpp	analogous example of C++ code needed to do the same thing

Makefile	makefile for building nctst

ncvalues.cpp	interface for auxilliary classes of typed arrays needed by
		netCDF interface; fairly simple

ncvalues.cpp	implementation of auxilliary classes of typed arrays needed by
		netCDF interface

nc.txn	        preliminary class documentation for the C++ interface,
		in Texinfo form.

nc.info		preliminary class documentation for the C++
		interface, in info form, as generated from the Texinfo
		source file.  The commented example program nctst.cpp may
		also be useful for understanding the interface
