	* Makefile: Removed '-undefined suppress'. Added '-c' switch for
	install. Changed permissions of installed .dylib - there is no
	reason to make it executable.

	* dlfcn.h: Added wrapper for C++.

	* dlopen.c: Added optional debugging output. Modules are now
	searched for in various directories when no absolute path is
	specified and the module is not found in the current directory. A
	new function, _dl_search_paths, was added to accomplish the
	search. Added an include for <limits.h>, because PATH_MAX is
	defined there.
	* Makefile: Some rearragements for the optional debugging
	output. (Use "make DEBUG=1" to enable it.)

	* dlopen.c: Removed #include for ofi.h - it doesn't seem to be
	needed.
