 dlcompat for Darwin
=====================

This is release 20010831 of dlcompat. dlcompat is a small library that
emulates the dlopen() interface on top of Darwin's dyld API. It is
based on a CVS snapshot of Apple's Darwin CVS repository, taken on
Jan 16 2001 (and still current as of Aug 31 2001). Since it's based on
Apple code, it is released under the terms of the Apple Public Source
License; see the file APPLE_LICENSE for the text of the license.

Changes were made to automatically search for the module in several
directories (taken from the environment variables DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
and LD_LIBRARY_PATH, plus /usr/lib and /lib) when no absolute path is
specified and the module is not found in the current directory. If you
prefer to run unmodified Apple code, download release 20010116.


 Installation
--------------
As root, type:

  make install

This will compile the source file, generate both a static and shared
library called libdl and install it into /usr/local/lib. The header
file dlfcn.h will be installed in /usr/local/include.

If you want to place the files somewhere else, run

  make clean
  make install prefix=<prefix>

where <prefix> is the hierarchy you want to install into, e.g. /usr
for /usr/lib and /usr/include (_NOT_ recommended!).

To enable debugging output, run

  make clean
  make DEBUG=1
  make install

Combinations of those commands are left as an excercise to the
reader. :-)


 Usage
-------
Software that uses GNU autoconf will likely check for a library called
libdl, that's why I named it that way. For software that doesn't find
the library on its own, you must add a '-ldl' to the appropriate
Makefile (or environment) variable, usually LIBS.

If you installed dlcompat into a directory other than /usr/local/lib,
you must tell the compiler where to find it. Add '-L<prefix>/lib' to
LDFLAGS (or CFLAGS) and '-I<prefix>/include' to CPPFLAGS (or CFLAGS).


 Genesis
---------
The files dlfcn.h and dlopen.c were originally taken from the Darwin
CVS, directory Commands/Apple/cctools/libdyld. The changes made
thereafter are clearly documented in the ChangeLog, as required by the
Apple Public Source License.

For release 20010116, I removed an unneccessary include statement from
dlopen.c and added the Makefile.

For release 20010123, I added debugging output and library searching.

For release 20010505, I added wrappers to disable C++ name
mangling. That allows the library to be used by C++ code, but be aware
that there are issues with C++ and bundles, like static initializers
not being called.

For release 20010831, the Makefile was adjusted to allow linking the
shared library using the Mac OS X 10.1 linker, and other minor
adjustments. The actual code is unchanged.
