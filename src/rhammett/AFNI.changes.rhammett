25 Jul 2005
   * modified thd_niftiwrite.c to mark AFNI +tlrc files
     as NIfTI talairach view files when writing

18 Jul 2005
   * modified thd_niftiwrite.c and thd_niftiread.c to allow
       better interoperability with FSL

13 Apr 2005
   * deprecated quite LOUDLY usage of 3dANALYZEtoAFNI
05 Apr 2005
   * created framework for AFNI to read and write NIFTI1 format files:
   * modified thd_initsess.c to list files in the session tree with
       a .nii extension
   * added thd_niftiwrite.c to write out NIFTI1 files
   * added thd_niftiwrite.h
   * added 3dAFNItoNIFTI.c to read in AFNI file and write out
       NIFTI1 file using the above code
   * modified Makefile.INCLUDE to build thd_niftiwrite.o and
      3dAFNItoNIFTI executable target
10 Aug 2004
   * modified mri_read.c to check input files for the dicom magic number
     before processing based on file name.
16 Jun 2004
   * modified 3dTstat.c to allow a statistical method to return
     multiple values (that is, multiple sub-BRIKS in the output
     data set).
   * modified 3dTstat.c to generate an arbitrary-length autocorrelation
     vector
   * modified 3dTstat.c to generate an arbitrary-order autoregression
     coefficient vector
11 Mar 2004
   * modified several files to allow proper reading and writing of
     the SPM Analyze coordinate space origin field
28 Jul 2003
   * modified mri_read_dicom.c to allow to3d to read and process 
     Siemens mosaic files while ignoring seemingly meaningful
     garbage text.  This was for a new case with even more
     extensive garbage than the 4 March 2003 case.

05 May 2003
   * modified mri_read.c to allow a switch to choose to try DICOM
     processing last on unknown files.  Set the environment variable
     AFNI_TRY_DICOM_LAST to YES.

04 Mar 2003
   * modified mri_read_dicom.c to allow to3d to read and process 
     Siemens mosaic files while ignoring seemingly meaningful
     garbage text.

25 Feb 2003
   * modified mri_read_dicom.c to allow to3d to read and process 
     Siemens mosaic files with less information than previous versions.

XX Feb 2003
   * modified 3dTsmooth.c to allow specification of an arbitrary (odd-order)
     filter in a text file for the smoothing operation.

XX Jan 2003
   * modified 3dTstat.c to allow specification of multiple statistics in
     a single command.
   * modified 3dTstat.c to output bucket datasets instead of single volume
     datasets.

XX Dec 2003
   * modified 3dTstat.c to add option to calculate the Durbin-Watson
     statistic (which measures first-order autocorrelation of data
     in time).
