Welcome to the "Programming OpenGL for the X Window System" GLUT-based
example source code.  The following table names each example program
directory and what section of the book discusses the example.

Section        Example directory
----------     ------------------
  4.1.1          glutsphere
  4.4            zoomdino
  5.1.3          lightlab
  5.2.4          mjkwarp
  5.3.3          blender
  5.4.5          splatlogo
  5.5.5          molehill
  5.6.7          origami
  5.7.4          glutduck (requires Open Inventor and C++)
  6.6.8          torus_test

To build any of these examples, you must first build the GLUT library
in "libglut".

NOTE:  This distribution contains a minimal implementation of GLUT 3.1
(in the "libglut" subdirectory) and its documentation (in the "doc"
subdirectory).  The full GLUT source code distribution contains lots
more GLUT examples, tests, and Fortran language bindings.  Please find
information about the latest GLUT source code distribution at:

  http://reality.sgi.com/mjk_asd/glut3/glut3.html

Or try:

  ftp://sgigate.sgi.com/pub/opengl/xjournal/GLUT

I've tried to make the Makefiles as simple and as portable as
possible.  If you find problems with these examples, please report bugs
to mjk@sgi.com
