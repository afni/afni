General Information
===================

This is the GTS library. GTS stands for the GNU Triangulated
Surface Library. It includes a number of useful functions to deal with
triangulated surfaces including, but not limited to, multi-resolution
models, Delaunay and Constrained Delaunay triangulations, set operations on
surfaces (intersection, union etc ...), bounding-boxes trees for efficient
collision and intersection detection, triangle strips generation for fast
rendering.

The official web site is:

Copying
=======

The GTS library is distributed under the terms of the Library General
Public License which is compliant with the guidelines of the Open
Source and Free Software Fundations. See the file COPYING for details.

The robust geometric predicates code (src/predicates.c) was written
and placed in the public domain by Jonathan R. Shewchuk. The original
version of the code can be found at

http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/robust.html

Installation
============

GTS uses the glib library which is part of gtk (http://www.gtk.org). If you
use linux there is a good chance that this library is already on your
system, otherwise, you'll need to install it.

A WIN32 glib port is available at
http://www.gimp.org/~tml/gimp/win32/downloads.html, however it is
recommended to use GTS within the Cygwin environment under windows.

Unix users (including cygwin users):

If you checked out GTS from sourceforge.net, you will need to have the
gnu autoconf tools installed.  Generate the "configure" script with
the following commands:

aclocal
autoheader
automake -a
autoconf

After this, or if you are installing from source where the configure
script is already built:

./configure
make
make install

See the file 'INSTALL' for generic configure instructions.


Windows users:
If you have Microsoft C try:

cd src
nmake -f makefile.msc install

or use Cygwin (http://www.cygwin.com)

Using GTS
=========

From version 0.5.0 you can use the `gts-config' script in order to
obtain the compile flags and link flags necessary to use the GTS
library (à la Glib).

- To compile add `gts-config --cflags` to your compiler flags.
- To link add `gts-config --libs` to your linker flags.

When developping code using GTS you probably want to enable control
over casting operations between objects of the GTS object
hierarchy. This can be done easily by defining GTS_CHECK_CASTS either
in the CFLAGS environement variable (CFLAGS=-DGTS_CHECK_CASTS) or on
the command-line of your compiler.

This will slow down your code but will warn you when you try to
perform illegal casts between GtsObjects.

You can also to do that using the `--check' option of gts-config,
i.e. by adding `gts-config --cflags --check' to your compiler flags.
