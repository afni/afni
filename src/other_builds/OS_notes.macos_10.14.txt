# notes for building AFNI on Mac OS 10.14, Mojave
# (based on the rantings of a crazed emperor)

# Mac has apparently hidden some system header files in the darkest
# depths of Mordor.  However there is a pkg that can be installed to
# add links to them from the standard locations.
# 
# These links are helpful in order to get the build to work under gcc.


# 1. install Xcode, comand line tools and XQuartz
#    (when upgrading the OS, new versions may be required)
#
# 2. open the .pkg file under /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages
#    and "open" the contained .pkg file
#
# 3. get off emperor's lawn
