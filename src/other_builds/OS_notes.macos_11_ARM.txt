#**************************************************************
# Notes for building AFNI on Apple Silicon ARM M1 or M2 CPU 
# with Mac OS 11 (Big Sur) or 12 (Monterey),
# using this makefile:
# Makefile.macos_11_ARM
# 
#**************************************************************
# install xcode and XQuartz as described in earlier Mac installation
# instructions.
#  Install Xcode and XQuartz
#  Copy+paste:

#  xcode-select --install

#   For …

#  … OS X >= 10.11, click on this link:
#   http://www.xquartz.org
#  Then click on the “Quick Download” DMG, and follow the instructions to install.
#**************************************************************
Terminal security preferences
The Terminal app needs extra permissions for programs like AFNI to look in some directories.
Otherwise, you can get a spray of warnings everytime the afni GUI opens.
You can give the Terminal app more permissions in 
Mac OS Preferences (Apple menu or Gear icon in dock, Security & Privacy,Privacy tab)
Select the Lock to unlock settings. 
If Terminal is not on list of applications on right, add it with the "+", and navigate
to the Applications/Utilities/Terminal
Then select Terminal to have check mark for full disk access

# Homebrew installation

# INSTALL the following with homebrew (for gcc, ver=10 is used here by

# default, though actually at the moment 'gcc' is just Mac's clang):

#install homebrew via this command (as before)

 /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"

  brew update
  brew install  libpng jpeg expat freetype fontconfig openmotif libomp \
                libxt gsl glib pkg-config gcc netpbm libiconv          \
                mesa mesa-glu libxpm

#**************************************************************
# R installation
# Install R for ARM64 (latest version is 4.1.2 at this time)
# https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html
# for example:
# http://cran.wustl.edu/bin/macosx/big-sur-arm64/base/R-4.1.2-arm64.pkg
# open package from browser, agree to prompts, provide password/touchid sensor
#**************************************************************

# update or create symbolic links
# LINK the following, but note that:
# + many of these existed already on my machine
# + many of these are version dependent, and so must be searched for.
# We might end up scripting some of this...
#
# These links all existed already on my computer:
# 
#   ln -s /opt/homebrew/Cellar/gsl/2.7.1/lib/libgsl.dylib                 \
#         /opt/homebrew/lib/libgsl.dylib  
#   ln -s /opt/homebrew/Cellar/openmotif/2.3.8_1/lib/libXm.4.dylib         \
#         /opt/homebrew/lib/libXm.4.dylib
#   # if XQuartz doesn't include libXm (as it used to), then use this:
#   ln -s /opt/homebrew/Cellar/openmotif/2.3.8_1/lib/libXm.a               \
#         /opt/homebrew/lib/libXm.a
#   ln -s /opt/homebrew/Cellar/jpeg/9e/lib/libjpeg.a                       \
#         /opt/homebrew/lib/libjpeg.a
# Changed make makefile to use libjpeg.a, so didn't need this one
#    ln -s /opt/homebrew/Cellar/jpeg/9e/lib/libjpeg.a                       \
#          /opt/homebrew/lib/libjpeg.9.a

# did have to do this link:
    ln -s /opt/homebrew/Cellar/netpbm/10.86.18/include/netpbm/pgm.h        \
          /opt/homebrew/include/pgm.h

  cp Makefile.macos_11_ARM_clang Makefile
# 
# note either clang or gcc10,gcc11 or later should all work
# ... and then firing off the make:
#
#   make vastness|tee make_mac11_ARM_clang.log
#
# make sure the installation all worked okay, and there are no missing
# programs, usually because of missing dependencies

# copy installation directory to standardish afni binary directory
mkdir -P ~/abin
cp -r macos_11_ARM_M1_clang/* ~/abin/

# get atlases and templates
