   "   the input stimulus functions are written as a single column of decimal integers\n"
   "   (rather than multiple columns of binary numbers).\n"
   "* The -stim_base option was added to Program 3dDeconvolve.  This modification\n"
   "   allows the user to specify which input stimulus functions are to be included\n"
   "   as part of the baseline model.  By default, the input stimulus functions are\n"
   "   not included in the baseline model.  This option will effect the output values\n"
   "   for the Full Model R^2 and Full Model F-stat, since these statistics indicate\n"
   "   the significance of the full regression model relative to the baseline model.\n"
   "   This option might be useful, for example, when the estimated motion parameters\n"
   "   are included as input stimulus functions.  In most cases, the user would want\n"
   "   the motion parameters to be part of the baseline model.  By indicating that\n"
   "   the motion parameters are part of the baseline model, they will not contribute\n"
   "   to the full regression model sum of squares.\n"
   "* The Deconvolution plugin was also modified to incorporate the above change.\n"
   "   On the far right of each stimulus function input line of the Deconvolution\n"
   "   plugin interface, there is a new option chooser labeled 'Base', which allows\n"
   "   the user to specify that this stimulus function is to be considered as part of\n"
   "   the baseline model.\n"
   "* The Deconvolution plugin was modified to allow a better graphical\n"
   "   representation of the estimated impulse response function when the user selects\n"
   "   option DC_IRF under Tran 1D of the graph options menu.  When using the DC_IRF\n"
   "   function, note that the Double Plot option should be set to 'Off'.\n"
