    TODO:
        - Variance in linear model used to assess quality.  (How it affects the
            variance in linear model. Ratio of variance with/without regressors)
            - Does it explain more of the variance in the data (which would be 
              a good thing) - (Permanent item)
        - Lags.  Number of lags.  Direction and size
            - Add -oldRVT (current retroicorTaylor) option, and ability to flip 
               RVT direction
            - Add RVT_lags option with 3 parameters:
                - (Relative (to onset of aqcuisition)) start time.  Beginning
                   of leftmost shift.  (Earliest time - currently -20 but is 
                   supposed) to be zero.  Currently beginning of -20 but ends at 0
                   due to 4 intervals of 5 seconds
                - (Relative) end time
                - # RVTs
        - Convolve RVT with some function using physiological regressors (Catie 
          Chang)
        - Get percentage of variance accounted for by cardio
        - Histogram of model
        - Remove large outliers in cardio
        - Duplicate current code over all slices
        - Per slice with cardio to deal with temporal offsets across slices
        - Try weird examples from physio dB
        - Options that might change do not have default
            
    DONE:
        - RVT without shifts (Single regressor for RVT.) 
        - Write alternative functions for
            - Finding peaks
            - Determining phase
            - Determining final output
        - Add options for Peter Lauren-written alternatives for
            - Finding peaks
            - Determining phase
            - Determining final output
        - Fix figure flashes in default mode
        - Offset for every slice relative to TR
            - afnipy/afni_util.py:slice_pattern_to_timing() gets the actual timing
        - Implement slice pattern.  Required option 
        - Allow dataset, as input, to determine TR, # slices, # time points and
            slice pattern.  Command line options could overwrite that. JSON file
        - EPI data set (Being used in afni_proc.py command)
        - Large smoothing to find peaks and troughs
        - Small smoothing to remove outliers
