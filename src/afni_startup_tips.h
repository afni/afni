 ,
   "The right-click popup menu on the label above the color overlay bar\n"
   "lets you control colorization from the OLay sub-brick in several ways:\n"
   " * you can jump crosshairs to the largest OLay value above threshold\n"

   "different options for saving image snapshots to a special 'Record' viewer.\n"
   "Once you have recorded the set of images you like, you can save them\n"

   "click on a dataset name in the OverLay or UnderLay popup chooser, AFNI\n"
   "will switch to viewing that dataset immediately (rather than waiting for\n"
   "you to press 'Set'). You can also browse through datasets in these\n"
   "choosers using the keyboard up/down arrows."
 ,
   "You can adjust the brightness and contrast of the underlay (grayscale)\n"
   " image by using the 'b' and 'c' arrows at the right of an image viewer.\n"
   "A more interactive method is to press and hold down the left mouse button,\n"
   " then drag the cursor around up/down (brightness) or left/right (contrast).\n"
   " With this method, you just wiggle the mouse around while left-click is\n"
   " down, and you can adjust the image grayscale until it looks good.\n"
   "The 'Norm' button will reset the grayscale contrast to the startup setting,\n"
   " in case you make things look terrible."
 ,
   "Set environment variable AFNI_CREEPTO to YES, and then the 'Jump to' button\n"
   "will move the crosshairs to the chosen location incrementally, rather than\n"
   "in one big jump.  The reasons for using this feature are (a) to help\n"
   "get a feel for the transit, and (b) just plain fun."
 ,
   "Right-click on the color bar in Define Overlay, and you can change the color\n"
   " scale that is used.\n"
   "You can switch the color bar to a discrete set of solid colors by using the\n"
   " menu labeled '#' just beneath the color bar.\n"
   "You can save an image of the color bar by right-clicking on the label above\n"
   " it, and choosing 'Save to PPM' from the popup menu."
 ,

   " then selecting the crop region by clicking+dragging in the image.\n"
   "You can Montage cropped images (all will be cropped the same way).\n"
   "Right-clicking on 'crop' will give a chooser where you can specify the\n"
   " cropping region size exactly."
 ,
   "You can use keyboard shortcuts to precisely adjust the threshold slider.\n"
   "Put the mouse over the slider, and then\n"
   " * down/up arrows    for tiny adjustments \n"
   " * page up/page down for larger adjustments"
 ,
   "In a graph viewer, you can restrict the plotting to a subset of the time\n"
   "points by using the 'Opt->Grid->Index Pin' menu item. This feature is most\n"
   "useful when viewing very lengthy datasets."
 ,
   "In a graph viewer, the default plotting method has the bottom of each graph\n"
   "using a separate value (the minimum in that voxel). You can also make them\n"
   "have a common baseline (minimum among all voxels in the graph window) or\n"
   "a global baseline (set by you) by using the 'Opt->Baseline' menu items."
 ,
   "At the bottom of a graph viewer is a bunch of text showing various\n"
   "information about what is being shown."
 ,
   "When looking at FMRI data graphs with a regular stimulus timing, it is\n"
   "helpful to set the graph grid lines to match the stimulus timing spacing.\n"
   "You can do this from the 'Opt->Grid->Choose' menu item."
 ,
   "You can have graphs drawn as box plots rather than as connected line segments,\n"
   "by using the 'Opt->Colors, Etc.->(Data) Boxes' menu item, or by pressing the\n"
   "'B' key when the mouse cursor is over the graph viewer window."
 ,
   "In the graph viewer 'Opt' and 'FIM' menus, items that have keyboard shortcuts\n"
   "have the key inside square brackets, as in 'Opt->Scale->Down [-]', meaning\n"
   "the '-' key will cause the graph to scaled down (vertically)."
 ,
   "Advanced graphing: you can change the x-axis values from being 0,1,2,... to be\n"
   "anything you want, chosen from a 1D text file (applies to all voxels) or from\n"
   "a 3D dataset (per voxel x-coordinates). The x-axis for the central sub-plot will\n"
   "be displayed as a vertical graph at the left of the graph viewer window. See\n"
   "the 'Opt->X-axis' menu items to do strange things."
 ,
   "The 'Define Datamode->Misc' menu has a lot of choices, a few of which are:\n"
   " * Voxel Coords? = show voxel indexes instead of mm coordinates in AFNI GUI\n"
   " * ULay Info     = show information from the UnderLay dataset header\n"
   " * Purge Memory  = eject datasets from memory, forcing reloads when viewed"
 ,
   "When saving an image (or a montage), you might want to turn the crosshairs off.\n"
   " You can do this from the 'Xhairs' menu in the AFNI controller.\n"
   "If you want all the sub-images in a montage to have crosshairs (instead of\n"
   " just the central image), turn the 'X+' button on."
 ,
   "Just below the slider bar in an image viewer is a label, such as\n"
   "'Axial: left=Left'. This label indicates that you are looking at an axial\n"
   "image and the software thinks that the left side of the image viewer is\n"
   "the subject's Left. Similarly, the sagittal viewer label would normally\n"
   "say 'Sagittal: left=Anterior'. However, these labels will change if you\n"
   "alter the image viewing orientation in the 'Disp' control panel."
 ,
   "When saving from the image viewer, the saved image is on the matrix of the\n"
   "dataset. It is NOT a screen capture; that is, the image saved will not depend\n"
   "on the size of the image viewer window. A montage image will be the full size\n"
   "of all the base images catenated together. You can also choose a 'Blowup'\n"
   "factor to scale the image size upward: factors from 2 to 8 are available."
 ,
   "You can tell the graph viewer to ignore the first few time points when plotting.\n"
   "Menu item 'FIM->Ignore' lets you choose how many to ignore by mouse clicks.\n"
   "Keypress 'I' increases the ignore count by 1, 'i' decreases by 1.\n"
   "Ignored points are plotted with little blue circles which take the value of\n"
   "the first non-ignored point."
 ,
   "If you have a complicated AFNI window layout you want to save, you can use\n"
   "'Define Datamode->Misc->Save Layout' to save a startup script that will\n"
   "be used when you re-start AFNI in the same directory to restore the AFNI\n"
   "windows to (approximately) the same state they had before."
