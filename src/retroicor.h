/* Transform cardiac waveform to cardiac phase:

   card is the cardiac waveform 1D data;
   card has at least 2 timepoints;
   card contains float data;
   threshold is the value that card data must exceed to be considered part of
   an R-wave peak;

   POST:
   return value is NULL on error,

   with the same number of timepoints as card;

   It is the caller's responsibility to call mri_free() on the returned struct.

   Note that in this implementation the start and end of the card data are
   considered to be R-wave peaks (see above P_c formula for why).

                   sum(H(b), b = 1 .. 100) * sgn(dR/dt)

   where R(t) is the resp signal amplitude normalized to (0, R_max),
         H(b) is the number of occurances in bin b of histogram H
              which divides (0, R_max) into 100 bins, each centred at
	      b * R_max / 100
     and dR/dt is computed by convolving with a 39-point kernel (quadratic)

   PRE:
   resp is the resp waveform 1D data;
   resp has at least 2 timepoints;
   resp contains float data;
   winsize is the size of the window on the resp data used to estimate slope;
   winsize >= 2;

   POST:
   return value is NULL on error,
   else, return value is the phase representation of the entire resp dataset
   with the same number of timepoints as resp;

   It is the caller's responsibility to call mri_free() on the returned struct.

   Implementation note: Convolution is overkill just to get sgn(dR/dt), so
   this implementation estimates the slope with the difference between 
   winsize-point means on either side of each point. Try setting winsize to
   1/2 the sampling rate of resp in Herz. The size of the histogram H is
   defined in RIC_HISTSIZE.
