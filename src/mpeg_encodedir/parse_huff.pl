# this program's purpose in life is to parse the Huffman tables
# and output C code which is awfully useful for translation

# typical usage:
# perl parse_huff.pl huffman.table
# ---> generates huff.c and huff.h

# source format:  # is a comment character
# Otherwise, there are three tab-separated fields in a line:
#    Run, Level, and VLC Code
# Run and Level are integers, corresponding to the RLE coding.
# The VLC code is what bits to generate, and is expected to be
#    composed of 1, 0, space, and 's'.  Spaces are ignored, and
#    s corresponds to the sign bit.  In the output of this program,
#    We'll completely right-shift the data, with a 0 for the sign
#    bit.  The encoder will make appropriate changes before outputing.
