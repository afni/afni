/*
 TUNE b [limit] lower limit on how different a block must be to be DCT coded
 TUNE c [file [color-diff]] Collect statistics on Quantization
 TUNE d [RateScale DistortionScale] Do a DCT in the P search, not just DIFF
 TUNE k [breakpt end [slope]] Squash small lum values
 TUNE l Figure out Laplacian distrib and use them to dequantize and do snr calc
 TUNE n Dont consider DC differenece in DCT searches
 TUNE q Do MSE for distortion measure, not MAD
 TUNE s [Max] | [LumMax ChromMax] Squash small differences in successive frames
 TUNE u disallow skip blocks in B frames
 TUNE w filename [c]  Write I block distortion numbers to file [with bit-rates]
 TUNE z Zaps Intra blocks in P/B frames.

 [ Note k and s make -snr numbers a lie, by playing with input ]
 [ Note d n and q are contradictory (can only use one)         ]
 [ Note c will not work on parallel encodings                  ]
