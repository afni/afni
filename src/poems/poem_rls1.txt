 
 UNDER the wide and starry sky
 Dig the grave and let me lie:
 Glad did I live and gladly die,
   And I laid me down with a will.

 This be the verse you grave for me:
 Here he lies where he long'd to be;
 Home is the sailor, home from sea,
   And the hunter home from the hill.

- Robert Louis Stevenson
